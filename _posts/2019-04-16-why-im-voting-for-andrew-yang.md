*Disclaimer: All the thoughts and opinions written are my own personal views on Universal Basic Income. I support most of my arguments with statistics and anecdotes taken from the resources below, but some conclusions are drawn based on my own experiences and assumptions. None of the content is sponsored or paid for in any way, and is representative of my own opinions.*

I first seriously thought about the idea of universal basic income last spring while taking Robert Reich's Wealth and Poverty class my final semester at Berkeley. The class mainly focused on the growing socioeconomic inequality in the country and social policies that could fix the problem. While I agreed the problem was real, the solutions discussed seemed to be antiquated (labor unions), overly complex (earned income tax credit), or had misaligned incentives (disability and welfare programs). This is how I began to formalize the idea of universal basic income in my mind. It appeared to be a simple solution to solve the multitude of problems we face in today’s economy. While I’m no expert in social policy, my continued research of UBI showed it’s not only feasible, but something 2020 democratic presidential candidate Andrew Yang wants to make a reality. I discovered Andrew Yang through an interview he did on Sam Harris’s [podcast](https://wakingup.libsyn.com/130-universal-basic-income){:target='_blank'} *Waking Up* (now titled *Making Sense*). While Andrew Yang has many other policies, his most important platform is the Freedom Dividend, which will pay every citizen over the age of 18 $1,000 every month. There’s a lot to understand in terms of implementation and consequences so let’s explore his freedom dividend platform, and see how it makes him the most compelling candidate for president.

### Feasibility

There are three questions I get whenever I bring up universal basic income with anyone. All are valid concerns but there are strong arguments answering the concerns raised by each of the questions. We'll start by answering these questions, hopefully showing that UBI is both feasible and realistic. We'll then address the consequences, both obvious and indirect, that would result from UBI and tie it back to Andrew Yang's 2020 presidential campaign.

***How much will it cost and how will you pay for it?***

There are approximately 327 million people in the United States, with about 77.4 percent of them over the age of 18. At $12,000 of basic income a year for each individual, we would need 3 trillion dollars. That’s a lot. So how do we get there? The Freedom Dividend will be phased in as a choice between current social welfare and receiving the dividend. This cuts down the cost as we currently spend [500 to 600 billion dollars](https://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2017/04/04/what-does-the-federal-government-spend-your-tax-dollars-on-social-insurance-programs-mostly/){:target='_blank'} in general welfare programs. Additionally, administering the Freedom Dividend is a much simpler task than all the administrative work needed to maintain food stamps, subsidized housing, earned income tax credit, and other blanket social safety nets.

The second source of funding the Freedom Dividend is a [value-added tax](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/v/valueaddedtax.asp){:target='_blank'} of 10%. The GDP of the United States is 19 trillion dollars. We have some of the most valuable companies in the world from Apple to Amazon, yet because of the structure of our tax system (a 21 percent corporate tax rate on *profits*), numerous tax breaks, and international tax havens, these companies pay almost no taxes. That means the wealth created by technological innovation is primarily benefiting these companies. A VAT at 10% is about half of the level of any other [developed country](https://www.ricksteves.com/travel-tips/money/vat-rates-in-europe){:target='_blank'}, meaning these companies would have no incentive to leave, and properly redistribute wealth created from technology to the people. This tax would generate approximately 800 billion dollars in additional revenue, and there are additional benefits funding a UBI would pose for tech companies as well, which I will touch on later.

Finally, money paid through the Freedom Dividend comes right back to the government. If you gave $1,000 to an upper class tech worker, they’d probably save it and invest in Bitcoin or the Lyft IPO. But if you gave this money to a student struggling to pay tuition or a single mother of two, that money is going right back into the economy, paying off loans and purchasing meals for a family. According to the [Roosevelt Institute](http://rooseveltinstitute.org/modeling-macroeconomic-effects-ubi/), it’s estimated that UBI will generate an additional 500 to 600 billion dollars in economic growth, expanding the economy by 12.56% over 8 years.

Obviously these numbers don't add up to the necessary 3 trillion dollars. But we can get most of the way there without diverting funds from any non-welfare related budget and taxing companies that benefit and continue to benefit from the automation and technology. The rest can be funded through taking out federal debt, the scenario which the Roosevelt Institute found to actually be the most beneficial in terms of increasing GDP. I’ll leave the rest to Andrew Yang.

***Won’t people not work at all or waste that money on vices?***

The short answer is no. Many studies, including a [World Bank article](http://blogs.worldbank.org/impactevaluations/do-poor-waste-transfers-booze-and-cigarettes-no) which consolidated findings from over 19 papers analyzing the spendings of individuals that received government assistance, showed that while there was a marginal increase in spending on vices, most people spend their money on things that benefit their lives from education, day-to-day groceries, and savings. One of the best examples Andrew Yang highlights often is the [petroleum dividend](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alaska_Permanent_Fund){:target='_blank'} for Alaska residents, where people spent that money on their children's education. UBI is like preventative medication, giving every individual a baseline level of support and hope before leading to problems like extreme debt and homelessness. Individuals with hope don’t waste their money - they invest in their future, from education, health, and family - all things that make our country stronger.

The second reason is that $12,000 a year is not enough to survive in most places in the country, especially places like San Francisco where the typical one bedroom could cost upwards of $3,000 a month. Our society is driven by consumption and more consumption, and while some people may figure out how to get by with $12,000 a year, most people would use that $12,000 as a supplement to another income source, and use that money to pay loans, buy luxury items, or invest in themselves. An economic [study](https://www.nber.org/papers/w24312.pdf) on Alaska's petroleum dividend found no effect on employment and actually an increase in part time employment, further supporting the fact that people will still work even when receiving the Freedom Dividend.

***How is this better than social welfare programs we have now?***

To start, the Freedom Dividend is an opt-in program, meaning current receivers of social welfare can choose to either receive their current welfare benefits or the Freedom Dividend. The Freedom Dividend has the advantage in its simplicity and as a result, flexibility for the individual to make their own decisions on how to allocate their capital. The current welfare system incentivizes people to not seek employment out of fear of [losing benefits](https://www.ssa.gov/planners/disability/work.html){:target='_blank'}, limiting their ability to generate additional income and by extension their social mobility. Because the Freedom Dividend is completely non-discriminatory, there is no need to check disability status or fudge income numbers to be just below a certain threshold. Everyone gets the same $1,000. The dividend also cannot be stigmatized as a transfer between the rich and the poor as everyone from Mark Zuckerberg to one of his entry level engineers to the contracted custodian receives the money.

### The Consequences

UBI directly solves the problem of absolute poverty, immediately giving every individual an opportunity to provide for their basic needs. It's absurd to me that homeless people panhandle outside some of the richest companies in the world in San Francisco and New York. We live in one of the richest countries in the world, pride ourselves in solving problems in other countries, and claim we are the land of opportunity, yet real human suffering sits right at our doorstep. The Freedom Dividend empowers every individual to make the decision to lift themselves out of poverty and prevents others from entering poverty.

However, there are even more indirect consequences that would be a huge benefit to society. UBI would be a key driver for social mobility. Andrew Yang paints a great picture what normal is in our country in his book [*The War on Normal People*](https://www.yang2020.com/buy-the-book/). To many of us, normal is a college grad working in tech or banking. Andrew Yang puts it best in his book:

> Smart people... do one of six things in six places: finance, consulting, law, technology, medicine, or academia in New York, San Francisco, Boston, Chicago, Los Angeles, or Washington DC.

I've worked in tech and finance in three of the six cities, and nearly every person I know and their parents does the same. This distorted view of reality is real. In reality, the average American didn’t graduate from college, has a net worth of about 36k, and lives paycheck to paycheck. Let’s take a moment to think about life in this person’s world. In today’s society, they’re trapped on the social ladder, working multiple minimum wage, dead-end jobs just to get by. They didn’t graduate from college, so they don’t have the requisite credentials for higher earnings potential. Any unexpected payment from a traffic ticket to a health bill would probably lead them to being homeless. The social mobility in this case is essentially zero. But now consider giving them an additional $12,000 a year. Maybe they work one less job and attend night school, hopefully increasing their earnings potential. Some people will be less stressed, able to pay off loans and save a little for the future. $1,000 a month would transform the lives of the normal American.

Even though big tech and other large industries stand to pay the most through the VAT if the Freedom Dividend were to be implemented, their market would be transformed if every individual in the United States had $1,000 of additional spending money. The internet has created economies of scale able to reach every individual in the country. Now imagine if every individual had $1,000 more to spend on services provided by companies like Amazon, Netflix, or Apple. A 2017 [study](http://www.businessofapps.com/data/netflix-statistics/){:target='_blank'} on the demographics of Netflix subscribers found that market penetration was higher amongst individuals making over $75,000, indicating there is a lot of growth potential in lower income brackets. The Freedom Dividend would give these lower income individuals more free capital to spend on leisure and entertainment, increasing the pool of potential Netflix subscribers. This observation can be extended to other tech companies as well. People may upgrade their iPhones more often and subscribe to more of Apple's new services. Amazon Prime members may be more likely to make that impulse purchase. The tech industry benefits when more people have more money. Other struggling industries like retail also stand to benefit from the Freedom Dividend. Both online and local retail would have millions of new customers, each with an additional $1,000 of potential spending money. This is capitalism at its finest, creating a trickle up economy of spenders, benefiting both the individual and the corporations.

Communities would also be transformed. People value a community with the cute local coffee shop or corner bakery. These niche stores create culture, but the individuals that live in that community drive that culture. An influx of money to every individual in a small town would lead people to dine out more often or spend time at a local coffee shop or bakery. This increased demand is a market opportunity for entrepreneurs. Entrepreneurs may open up a new coffee shop or restaurant to meet this new demand of customers. Local shopping malls and movie theatres would have a community full of new customers. Growing small business revive the life and culture of these communities. I’ve driven across the country, and to those that have lived in a city or densely populated suburb, it’s easy to forget that most of the country is empty farmland with scattered small towns in between. [5 million individuals](https://medium.com/basic-income/self-driving-trucks-are-going-to-hit-us-like-a-human-driven-truck-b8507d9c5961){:target='_blank'} in these small towns work in industries like hotels and dining that support 3.5 million truckers. Automation of truck driver jobs would wreck these local communities. It’s time to transform these communities before it’s too late.

Nothing sparks an economy more than giving lots of people that spend money even more money. Local communties would be revitalized. Families would be happier and individuals would have more opportunity. At the very least, everyone would have the means to a meal and a bed. The consequences of the Freedom Dividend are far reaching, and some of them we won't even know until the policy is implemented.

### What You Can Do

As someone fortunate enough to be working in finance and tech, I am reaping some of the benefits of the technology boom. Never have college students and recent graduates had opportunities to work six-figure jobs in some of the biggest cities in America. Technology has made today's society richer than it ever has been, but to many it doesn't feel that way. The Freedom Dividend can change that. The benefits of technology, artificial intelligence, and automation should not just be available to those that have learned to code or have the capital to invest in the latest tech unicorn. These advancements should allow us to pursue our passions, not work more than we ever have. Tech should be the catalyst for social mobility, not the inhibitor and creator of economic inequality. We should not be afraid of tech. Rather, we need to get ahead of the changes technology is imposing on society, and Andrew Yang's Freedom Dividend policy is that step forward.

Many of Yang’s other policies are similar to other policies discussed by Democratic candidates, but his game changing policy is the Freedom Dividend. It’s a policy that will change not just our economies and our communities, but the well-being of every individual in the country. It’s time to put Humanity First. Andrew Yang has my vote.
