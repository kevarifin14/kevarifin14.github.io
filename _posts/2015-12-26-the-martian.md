### The Martian

When I was a senior in high school, I realized that life is about continuing the
survival of humanity. To do so, I narrowed it down to three paths in increasing
importance to take to achieve this goal. The first is health and fitness,
promoting healthy life-styles so humans can productively work to solove the world's
problems. The second is climate change, saving the only planet we know. The third is
space, the unknown that is necessary to explore if humanity as a species wants to
survive. *The Martian* rekindled thoughts of that revelation in my life. As Matt Damon
talked about in the movie, space is something greater than himself, and I hope in
the future I can work on something that is greater than myself.
