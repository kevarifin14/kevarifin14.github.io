Imagine a world where streaming services were fragmented by genre. You could only find animated children's movies on Disney+, Netflix had all the horror movies, HBO was the king of comedy, and so on. But no one watches just one genre of movie - you’d have to juggle multiple subscription services. Coincidentally enough, this is kind of what's happening as everyone gets into the streaming video on demand game, but at least a Netflix subscription can satisfy most of your digital entertainment needs.

This thought experiment describes the current state of digital fitness. Each company offers a specific “genre” of exercise - [Peloton](https://www.onepeloton.com){:target='_blank'} for spin classes, [Glo](https://www.glo.com){:target='_blank'} and [Gaia](https://www.gaia.com/yoga/practices){:target='_blank'} specializing in yoga, [Tonal](https://www.tonal.com){:target='_blank'} with cable-based strength workouts, and independent trainers offering workout videos and programs for their own niche.

Fitness isn't a result of just doing one kind of workout. A common complaint about working out is how boring doing the same types of exercises is week after week. Not only is doing a different type of exercise more fun, studies have shown that cross-training (doing different types of exercise) reduces the chances of injury.

Another aspect of digital fitness is having access to a large library of trainers. Every individual can find the best trainer for them for any type of exercise. After trying out several instructors for Glo, I found an instructor I liked and have only done yoga classes with him. When watching workout videos online, I generally stick with athletes I trust like [Kevin D Lo](https://www.instagram.com/kevindlo/?hl=en){:target='_blank'} and [ThenX](https://www.thenx.com){:target='_blank'}. Personal training is personal because each individual has a different set of fitness goals, so individuals gravitate towards the trainers they trust to help them achieve their respective goals.

With these insights into the digital fitness space, these are the problems with the existing ecosystem:

1. Too specific on the type of exercise.
2. Too broad on the selection of teachers.

#### The Marketplace for Digital Fitness

Enter a marketplace for digital fitness. Instead of a subscription to a company like Peloton or Tonal, you can subscribe to individual coaches. Think the [Substack](https://substack.com){:target='_blank'} of digital fitness. (For those unfamiliar with Substack, they provide a platform for writers to create blogs and newsletters and monetize them through subscriptions.)

One side of the digital fitness marketplace is the people creating digital fitness content. Let's call them trainers. The other side of the marketplace is individuals interested in working out. Let's call them athletes. This is how I envision the marketplace for digital fitness:

1. Any trainer can upload self-created fitness content. Examples include training videos such as a spin class or a weightlifting workout, books and workout guides, and motivational videos. They set a monthly subscription price to access their content.
2. Athletes can subscribe to set of trainers that help them reach their personal fitness goals. They pay a monthly subscription fee for access to each trainer's content.
3. The platform provides services that make it easy to become a successful digital trainer. From assisting with content creation to helping with customer discovery, the marketplace lowers the barrier for entry to become a digital trainer. From an athlete perspective, the platform can leverage usage patterns to recommend and personalize a set of trainers to subscribe to.

This marketplace solves the two problems of the digital fitness marketplace today. Athletes can diversify their workouts by subscribing to the set of trainers across many different types of exercise. In my personal case, I'd have access to the best weightlifting, calisthenics, spin, and yoga trainer that fits my tastes.

A marketplace would attract the best trainers because their upside is unlimited compared to coaching exclusively for a company like Peloton.

Peloton's excellent spin instructors drive a lot of the recurring subscription profit, which amounted to $77.4 million for the fiscal year ending in June 2019. The average Peloton instructor makes about $300,000 and there are about 30 instructors, which means Peloton instructors shared in just about 12% of the subscription profits.

While Peloton definitely deserves to reap much of those profits by aggregating the demand of spin class enthusiasts, some of the best spin instructors could drive high subscriptions by themselves. Assuming that the marketplace takes a cut similar to marketplaces like Airbnb and Uber, a marketplace would allow trainers on the platform to capture 80% to 90% of the subscription revenue.

The best trainers would bring along their loyal following to the platform, who can now subscribe at a lower rate since they are just paying for the trainer they love. As the athlete base on the platform increases, the marketplace becomes an aggregator of digital fitness demand.

This makes monetizing a passion for fitness possible for everyone. Just as Substack allows anyone to monetize a newsletter, this marketplace allows anyone to monetize their fitness passion. ThenX can upload their workouts to the marketplace instead of building out their on app, which is missing the network effects of the marketplace. Someone who recently underwent a body transformation and lost a lot of weight can share their workouts and exercises to the niche of people interested in weight loss and body transformation.

The marketplace for digital fitness is also a highly scalable and protiable business as well. Let's evaluate a digital fitness marketplace as a tech company using the criteria from [Stratechery's Ben Thompson](https://stratechery.com/2019/what-is-a-tech-company/){:target='_blank'}.

* **Software creates ecosystems:** A software marketplace creates an ecosystem of athletes and trainers.

* **Software has zero marginal costs:** The marketplace is like Peloton without the bikes. The services the marketplace provides are a zero marginal cost offering.

* **Software improves over time:** The platform constantly improves. For trainers, the platform can continue improving its offering of tools for content creation and distribution which lowers the barrier for entry to become a digital trainer. For both trainers and individuals who work out, the more data the platform has, the better the platform can connect trainers and individuals.

* **Software offers infinite leverage:** Any trainer can now reach the entire world, and every individual working out can find the right trainer to achieve their fitness goals, no matter what type of exercise.

* **Software enables zero transaction costs:** Trainers and individuals can make frictionless one-on-one transactions using the marketplace.

The marketplace for digital fitness checks all five boxes for being a tech company. The last mover in the digital fitness space is going to be the marketplace that aggregates the supply of digital fitness. The best trainers are going to be on this platform because it gives them superior distribution and direct connection with athletes everywhere. Athletes want to train with the best trainers for them, and everyone has their own fitness goals. The marketplace leverages the internet to find the trainer just for you, whenever you want, wherever you want.


<!-- Most of the individual trainers have separate apps, books, or product lines to try to monetize their passion. But this only makes the market even more fragmented . On top of a subscription to peloton and glo you’d pay for an app from thenx and a program from athleanx. That’s four different places where you have to manage a subscription, just to workout.



People have always shown a willingness to pay for their health. Peloton sells a 2000 dollar bike, Apple watches are hundreds of dollars, Fitbits used to be everywhere. Money is there waiting to be spent in the right place.

More importantly, fitness training is about the coach. By subscribing to Peloton or Tonal, you are subscribing to the whole library of teachers but in reality you probably stick with your favorite one. People subscribe to individual trainers all the time already like Kayla itsines or thenx but because of the fragmentation, only the select few can make a living off of being a digital trainer.



The solution is to build a marketplace for fitness coaches and workout people.

Nick regularly buys programs from AthleanX or works out watching videos of ThenX. I get workouts by watching Kevin D Lo’s workout videos and jotting down a list of his exercises. But wouldn’t it be better if I could walk through the workout with him?

The average peloton trainer makes between 250k and 300k. There are about 30 peloton trainers. 9 million dollars. 915 million in revenue FY ending June 2019. Trainers right now are just receiving 1% of the market.

Peloton stats
181.1 million in subscription revenue

The platform:

1. Like Substack or podcasting, providing baseline tools to prepare and stream workout videos.
2. Direct relationship between trainer and athlete. No third parties or companies; we just facilitate a relationship.
