When we talk about unbundling, we all think of unbundling the cable package. Instead of paying one cable company one fee for all the channels, we subscribe to different streaming video on demand services like Netflix and Hulu and watch what we want, when we want.

But the more interesting unbundling is happening in business. In the past, companies had to handle everything: customer relations, documents and contractual agreements, internal communications, single sign on. Now there's a company that does each of these: Zendesk, Docusign, Slack, and Okta, among many others.

This deconstruction of the company allows these smaller companies to focus specifically on solving a business problem 10x better than a company's in-house solution. It makes more sense to pay Slack hundreds or thousands of dollars a month to handle internal communication rather than hire your own engineers to build and maintain an internal Slack. That's the foundation of the SaaS business model, and the internet allows these companies providing specific business solutions to capitalize on these verticals at almost zero marginal cost.

Companies used to have full divisions focused on these internal tasks like communication, video conferencing, email security, or single sign-on, but each of these pieces is now broken up into a full company. This leads to the unbundling and decentralization of the company.

Let's call this the bifurcated company distribution, inspired by Alex Danco's [article](https://alexdanco.com/2015/12/17/taylor-swift-ios-and-the-access-economy-why-the-normal-distribution-is-vanishing/){:target='_blank'} on the bifurcation of our economy. The bifurcated company distribution means that there will be a few monolithic companies that synthesize a diverse ecosystem and capitalize on immense returns to scale and a long tail of smaller companies that provide the 10x solution to a small set of problems. In fact, this type of thing is already happening today. Take a look at the largest 100 stocks on NASDAQ by market cap.

There's a collection of the super-large organizations: think Microsoft, Apple, Google, Facebook, Amazon. Everyone else is part of the long tail. But that long tail is huge. I left out 2,900 other companies from the chart, which would only accentuate the bifurcation of companies.

Apple makes iPhones, tablets, speakers, and watches, and tries to stay on the cutting edge of both hardware and software. This requires immense scale and integration across that scale to create a seamless ecosystem of products. Amazon is the everything store. It controls the end-to-end pipeline of sale to distribution for retail. It's scale allows it to offer one-day shipping and cheaper products. Microsoft is the enterprise ecosystem, but the most contentious of the monoliths. Microsoft provides a suite of enterprise products like Windows, Teams, Outlook, and Azure, but can they do it better than company focused solely on that specific enterprise product?

This brings us to the long tail. Services companies Service Now, Okta, Zoom, and Zendesk make up this long tail, and they have been some of the best performing stocks this year. Each has a market cap well north of 5 billion dollars, and they employ between 1,000 and 6,000 individuals. In contrast, Apple employees 132,000 employees and has a nearly 1 trillion dollar market cap.

Company's will only get smaller and the bifurcated distribution of companies ever more pronounced. More startups will bite off parts of a business, like recruiting, legal, or bank transfers, until all that's left is the core of the company. I'm not arguing this is a bad thing. This is a net positive for everyone who starts a business. People start businesses not to deal with legal overhead or building internal tools - they start companies to solve a unique problem they see with the world. The more they can focus their team's attention on those problems, the more engaged everyone will be.

Of course, being in the long tail doesn't mean you'll be there forever. There will be the occasional black swan that moves from the long tail to becoming a monolith. But those aren't the companies that bite off business problems and provide 10x better services. They are the ones that use existing business solutions to singularly focus on solving human problems. Potential black swans are Uber (if they figure out self-driving) or Tesla (if they deliver on a lot of their promises).

The unbundling of the business makes crazy ideas like these possible. Company's can focus solely on their mission and outsource different aspects of what a business used to be to specialist companies. This is the future of the unbundled business, and we are just witnessing the start of it.

<!-- Counterintuitively, the greater the bifurcation of the company distribution in a particular industry, the higher likelihood of a black swan. Unbundling the business lowers the barrier for entry for individuals to tackle new problems like climate change, autonomous driving, or brain machine interfaces. Extreme bifurcation is the consequence of operating in a playing field where value creation is unbounded by physical limits. It's also what creates innovation: the off chance of an individual synthesizing a solution to the hard problems we face. -->
