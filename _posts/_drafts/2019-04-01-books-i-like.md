I recently finished two books while on vacation: *Loonshots: How to Nurture the Crazy Ideas That Win Wars, Cure Diseases, and Transform Industries* by Safi Bahcall and *How the Internet Happened: From Netscape to the iPhone* by Brian McCullough. I highly recommend reading the two books in tandem starting with *Loonshots*. *Loonshots* gives the framework to analyze the rise and fall and second rise of internet companies, as franchise projects like the PC failed to see the rise of the internet and initial internet companies failed to cultivate the appropriate S-type loonshots to make successful businesses (more on what that means later).

## *Loonshots*

## *How The Internet Happened*
Reading How the Internet Happened felt like living through a huge event in a movie like thanos snapping his fingers or the Death Star blowing up, not realizing anything important was going on, and finally learning what happened. As someone born in the mid 90s I was barely cognizant for the rise and fall of the dot com bubble. By the time I was old enough to appreciate technology, things like smart phones and social media had become ubiquitous. The internet has changed every part of our lives, and it is essential to understand the historical context of that change.

The two key takeaways of the books revolve around two central ideas: why the internet has changed society the way it has and how internet companies have become the prototypes for the rise and fall of loonshots and franchise projects.

If I had to boil down the book into four words, they would be:

Unlimited selection. Instant gratification”

How the Internet Happened

This phrase is repeated many times throughout the book and perfectly encapsulates why the internet changed the world the way it has. Let’s work backwards. the iPhone is the culmination of the maturation of the internet. It is the gateway to instant gratification. From there we have access to companies that embody these four words. Netflix gives unlimited tv shows and movies, instantly bingeable. Facebook allows us to instantly communicate with a basically unlimited number of friends. Through Google, we can instantly find any video or web pages from the infinite realm of the internet. The list goes on and on. But these companies weren’t always around. Before Netflix, there was Blockbuster. Google was predated by companies obsessed with the internet portal like Yahoo and AOL. Facebook had Friendster and MySpace as its ancestors. And before that, we had a society doubtful of the change both the PC and internet would bring about. It’s almost comical to look at the words people used to describe the potential of the internet:


No one expected the internet to change the world the way it has, and we weren’t ready for it. I recently read David Perell’s blog post what the hell is going on and it ties together the consequences of the internet. The abundance of information on the consumer side has transformed commerce, education, and politics in particular. It all goes back to unlimted selection and instant gratification. The internet has given us reviews and opinions from a multitude of perspectives on any product we purchase, any school we want to attend, and any politician or piece of legislation we are interested in. One part of the article really stuck with me:

Quote about lots of opinions not jsut from mass media.

The internet has created a society as diverse as we truly are. The systems of mass media and politics are struggling to keep up with this drastic shift.
