*WARNING: May contain spoilers about how I reacted to the movie.*

The new Star Wars was incredible. Watching it on the big screen IMAX at the Metreon
in San Francisco at 2:30 in the morning made it an even more special experience. I'll
keep this post more towards my personal reactions to the movie rather than my
opinions about how Disney chose to continue the Star Wars saga.

The biggest takeaway I got from the new Star Wars was really not that deep. I love
Star Wars. Throughout the movie, I got chills and did not feel tired even watching
it into the early hours of the morning. The movie felt surreal, and even though
I'm disappointed they uncanonized the old expanded universe, I can't wait to explore
the new expanded universe.
