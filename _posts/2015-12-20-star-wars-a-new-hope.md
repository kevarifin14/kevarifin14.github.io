### Star Wars Episode IV: A New Hope

Watching a Star Wars movie for the first time in two years was definitely an
extremely nostalgic experience. Many of my strongest thoughts I had from watching
Episode IV went back to the analysis from a Mr. Healy's Hero's Journey class
I took at Bellarmine. I still remember the cycle the hero goes through: a dissatisfaction
of being where they are, fear when presented the opportunity to leave, crossing the threshold and
receiving training along the way to complete a daunting challenge, and finally
returning home with the gift.

The movie also definitely got me excited to watch the new Star Wars
later tonight. It's been quite a while since experiencing a completely new Star
Wars movie experience which is why I love the books so much. Look out for my coming
reflection on the new Star Wars movie!
