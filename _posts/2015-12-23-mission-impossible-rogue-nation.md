### Mission Impossible: Rogue Nation

*Mission Impossible: Rogue Nation* was a surprisingly good movie with a lot of
plot twists and uncertainties in character roles. An interesting takeaway I had
was the premise of this movie was extremely similar to the latest James Bond movie.
Both movies were based on the idea that the leading organization of the respective
country's secret service agencies were disbanded and then the main character had
to go rogue to fight the long-standing enemy.
