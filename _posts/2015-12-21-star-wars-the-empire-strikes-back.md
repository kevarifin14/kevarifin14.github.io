### Star Wars Episode V: The Empire Strikes Back

Hours before watching the new Star Wars, I spent some time continuing my rewatching
of the Star Wars trilogy. Episode V was quite the treat since I had not watched it
often when I was younger since my family did not own the DVD. It definitely did not
disappoint and it was interesting having a more mature perspective on relationships
and seeing the relationship between Han and Leia play out. Han was definitely
quite brash towards Leia throughout the whole movie, something I didn't notice
in the past.

Continuing with the theme of relationships, the Yoda and Luke dynamic was especially
interesting because of how much George Lucas chose to portray Yoda like a fool.
One of his age-old adage that will always stick with me is the power of belief. When
Luke tries to raise the X-Wing out of the swamp with the Force, he fails and cannot believe
it when Yoda does this seemingly impossible feat minutes later. Luke says that he cannot
believe and in resposne Yoda proclaims, "That is why you failed." It's a seemingly self-apparent
line but it does hold a lot of meaning in determing personal success.
