*A Brief History of Time* by Stephen Hawking was one of the most fascinating books I've read. It made me imagine reliving my college experience and studying physics instead of computer science. It left me feeling in awe wondering how the world comes together in a mysterious way at the quantum level and insignificant at the macro level learning how vast the universe is.

Theories are just our best guesses about how the world around us works. This book reminded me that these paradigms are constantly changing, and changing faster than ever. It took us thousands of years to learn that the Earth revolved around the Sun, but since that moment we've discovered Newtonian physics to describe the world in a deterministic manner, relativity to define the world in the context of the speed of light, and quantum physics to describe the world in a probabilistic and uncertain manner.

In this post, I attempt to describe the my favorite things I learned from the book. While in no way do I compare to Stephen Hawking at explaining extremely complicated ideas in a simple manner, I hope the ideas are still enlightening and thought-provoking.

#### 1. Space Time Cone

Our life is just moving through space and time. If you're sitting reading a book, then time moves as your body moves through space with the Earth's movements. In a car, you have some control over your movement through space and continue to move through time. Meeting up with someone for lunch is just being at the same coordinates in space at the right moment in time.

But we only experience these events through the transfer of information. We see the person sitting across from lunch because light reflects off them into your eyes and your brain processes who that person is. But light doesn't travel infinitely fast. According to relativity, the speed of light is the speed limit of the universe. For an extremely small moment in time, you don't see the person in front of you because you are outside of the future light cone of the event (dark shaded area above).

It's hard to picture this space time cone in our day-to-day life because light is so fast, so we need to zoom way out and look at an event between the Earth and Sun. It takes eight minutes for light to reach Earth. That means every time we look at the Sun, we see it as it was eight minutes ago.

As time passes, Earth starts to enter the light cone formed by light traveling from the sun. Taking the example above, consider the event where the Sun suddenly dies. When it dies, we don't know that event happened for the first eight minutes. If light cannot reach us in the first eight minutes, then nothing can; not heat from the sun, sounds from the explosion, nothing. We are outside the light cone of the event. Eight minutes later, we enter the light cone and realize we are screwed.

Our life is just intersections of these light cone events. Quite might blowing.

#### 2. Elementary Elementary Particles

We all know about protons, electrons, and neutrons from middle school chemistry. We're told these particles make up atoms, the elementary building blocks of everything around us.

But there are particles that make up these elementary particles called quarks. Different quarks have quirky types called flavors too: up, down, strange, charmed, bottom, top. And each quark also has a color: red, green, or blue. Combinations of these different quarks form different particles.

The coolest thing about quarks is the concept of spin. But spin isn't like a basketball spinning while balancing on your finger. Spin refers to how much you have to rotate something for it to look the same.

The dot above is spin 0. At every point of rotation, it looks the same. Spin 1 is like the Ace of Spades above: turn it 360 degrees and it looks the same. Spin 2 is like the Queen of hearts: turn it 180 degrees and it looks the same.

Things can also have fractional spins! A spin of $$\frac{1}{2}$$ means you have to rotate it twice for it to look the same. I don't have an example for that.

Spins are important because different spins define different types of particles. All matter is made of particles with $$\frac{1}{2}$$ spin and particles of spin 0, 1, and 2 make up forces between matter particles.

Ok my head is spinning so I'll stop there.

#### 3. Why We are Three-Dimensional

It's easy to not think about why we live in a 3-D world. But when you really think about it, why do we only live in three dimensions and not two or four?

A three dimensional world is the goldilocks number of dimensions. It's impossible to make a complex enough universe with just one dimension. Two dimensions allow for a little more complexity, but basic things like moving past another person would be impossible. To pass another person on the street, we'd have to climb over them, like we're a character in Super Mario Bros.

Two dimensions make it difficult to create the complexity of our bodies. Every complex living organism consumes food and excretes waste. Unless the food comes out the way it came in, the passage of nutrients would cut any living 2-D creature into two parts. Blood circulation would also be impossible in two dimensions.

But what about higher dimensions? To figure out why four or more dimensions would not be good for life, let's remind ourself about the handy equation for the force of gravity in Newtonian physics:

$$
F = G \times \frac{m_1 m_2}{r^2}
$$

*F* is the force of gravity, *G* is a constant number that's always the same, $$m_1$$ and $$m_2$$ are the masses of the two object we are trying to calculate the force of gravity between, and $$r^2$$ is the distance between the two objects.

The $$r^2$$ value is the important one. This equation describes gravity in three dimensions. Thus, if something is if Earth is two times farther from our Sun, the force of gravity would be four times weaker.

In four dimensions, the $$r^2$$ would actually be an $$r^3$$ and in five dimensions, the $$r^2$$ would be an $$r^4$$. So a two times increase in distance would be an eight times decrease in gravity in four dimensions and a sixteen times decrease in gravity in five dimensions. The force of gravity decreases much faster in higher dimensions.

That makes systems like Earth revolving around the Sun highly unstable in higher dimensions. The stability of Earth is essential for us to survive.

So two or less dimensions doesn't allow the complexity for us to live. Four or more dimensions is too unstable for us to live. Three is just right.
