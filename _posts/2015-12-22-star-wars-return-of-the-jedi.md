### Star Wars Episode VI: The Return of the Jedi

I've been watching Star Wars too much recently, but I wanted to complete the trilogy.
My biggest takeaway was with the movie's title and direction into the new movie. This
one is titled *The Return of the Jedi*. However, Episode VII stresses how the Jedi have
become a myth. That seems to puzzle me. I guess more mystery and personal excitement to
see how they unravel this new expanded universe.
