*Welcome to the first installment of Books I Like. This will be an ongoing series about some of my favorite books and key takeaways from the book. I’ll try to keep the spoilers to the minimum and focus more on why you should check these books out and some things to think about while reading them. You can find my full reading list [here](/reading-list#books). As always, I’m open to new recommendations to add to my reading list!*

## *Enders Game*

*Ender's Game* is my favorite book of all time. I’ve read the book twice, the first time in 2012, the second in 2016. I remember reading the book cover to cover on a six hour drive home from LA during spring break in 2016. The book enraptured me like no other book has before. The universe Card paints is both imaginative and unique but realistic at the same time. The plot is compelling, but the most powerful aspect of the book is its character development. Orson Scott Card is a masterful storyteller, and the main driver of his stories is his ability to create dynamic characters with so much depth that evolve throughout the story. The book follows the unorthodox childhood of Ender Wiggins as he is trained to command the human fleet fighting against the feared alien species known as Buggers. While he is seen as boy genius and a masterful tactician, what separates him from other trainees is his compassion, which I think is one of the key takeaways from the book and impacted me a lot. A friend asked me once why I never seem to get mad. I never really thought about it at that point in my life, but I realized a lot of it was me internalizing the words of Ender:

> In the moment when I truly understand my enemy, understand him well enough to defeat him, then in that very moment I also love him. I think it's impossible to really understand somebody, what they want, what they believe, and not love them the way they love themselves.

In a time when society and politics is as divisive as ever, learning to understand each other at a human level is essential if we hope to continue prosper as a society. When we truly understand the “alien”, from the immigrant who just moved to the United States to an impoverished individual in a country halfway across the world, we learn that we are really not that much different, humans fighting to find meaning and happiness.


## *Quiet*

Never has a book spoken to me as much as Susan Cain’s *Quiet*. I struggled with my identity as an introvert growing up, feeling awkward in social situations and always feeling pressured to speak out. Reading this book made me realize these feelings were normal and helped me accept them as part of who I am and see them as strengths, not weaknesses to be suppressed. As I’ve grown older, you could say I’ve grown out of my introversion. In high school I tested as ISTJ, which is about as introverted as it gets. Since then, I’ve consistently been categorized as INTP and gone from about 67 percent "I" to 51 percent "I" according to the truncated test on [16Personalities](https://www.16personalities.com). A lot of people I've met have even mistaken me as extroverted. A lot of this is becoming more comfortable with myself. But part of it is understanding what introversion is. Introversion isn't shyness, but where I draw my energy from. Susan Cain succinctly defines the difference between introversion and extroversion in her book:

> Introverts recharge their batteries by being alone; extroverts need to recharge when they don’t socialize enough.

Accepting my introversion has empowered me to appear more outgoing and comfortable in social situations. For anyone that's an introvert, this book is a must read. For extroverts, this book is still valuable in understanding their introverted counterparts and the importance of quiet, listening, and introspection.
