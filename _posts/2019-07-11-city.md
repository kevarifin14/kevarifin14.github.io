I spent the first 18 years of my life in the suburbs of the South Bay Area. I took the bus once, occasionally took the Caltrain up the Peninsula, and didn't take the BART until I moved to Berkeley for college. It wasn't until I went on a family vacation to Hong Kong did I experience a modern city, and I've been hooked ever since.

The density of people, the diversity in coffeeshops and restaurants, and the towering architecture make cities feel alive in such a unique way. My favorite activity when traveling, or even while living in a city, is just exploring different parts of the city and observing the people and architecture. Through all my travels, I've become increasingly curious about why cities are the way they are today.

I discovered Edward Glaeser's *Triumph of the City* from [Devon Zuegel's cities reading list](https://devonzuegel.com/post/cities-reading-list){:target='_blank'}, and it was a great read for foundational knowledge on the history of cities and the elements of successful cities. In this post, I compile the knowledge from the book and my own experiences to define my two first principles of successful cities.

## 1. Designed for people

When you think about a city, some examples that come to mind are New York, Hong Kong, or Singapore. Dense, bustling, and alive. It's awesome to be a person moving through these cities. Walk 20 feet and you see a new set of coffee shops, bars, restaurants, and shops. Hop on a train and it takes you to a whole different neighborhood with its own unique culture. These are cities designed for people.

It sucks being a car in these cities. Tight roads, congestion, and pedestrians jaywalking out of nowhere. In my opinion, that's a good thing. Cars should be the last resort to get around a city. Cities are made for people.

Let's take compare cities designed for cars and cities designed for people.

The left image is Ho Chi Minh city in Vietnam. Wide roads filled with cars and motorcycles encroach pedestrians trying to cross the street. There are some high-rises, but they are generally single-use buildings.

The right image is Sunnyvale. This might be the densest part of the South Bay Area, yet it's still built for cars. Wide roads and wide buildings. It's not a very interesting place to walk.

On a side note, it was way harder for me to find pictures of cities designed for people, which I think shows how uninteresting these types of places can be. With that in in mind, let's take a look at cities designed for people.

The left photo is Lincoln Park taken from an elevated train platform. It looks similar to the photo of downtown Sunnyvale, but we see more dense, mixed-use buildings, smaller roads with clear bike lanes, and nice tree-lined streets.

On the right is the Midtown West neighborhood of New York. Small shops and bike lanes line narrow streets. Buildings are taller than Lincoln Park and are mixed use as well. It's an exciting place to walk around.

Cities designed for people are built for people scale. People like looking at new stores, restaurants, and coffeeshops every 15 feet. Cities are stimulating and different because of their density. You only get this by building up and not out, and zoning mixed-use commercial and residential buildings.

Here are some interesting statistics to close out this first part. Humans need 9 square feet of space where are cars take up between 300 and 400 square feet. The typical parking spot is about 120 square feet. That's about double the size of the typical office cubicle. By building a city for cars, you by default make it unappealing to walk.

Build cities for people. They're more interesting and stimulating. They encourage people to walk, ride a bike, or take a train. But most importantly, bring people together and empower them to live more efficiently.

## 2. Empowering people

We talked a lot about structure and design in the previous section, but the most important part of a city is the people and empowering them to live better. Young college graduates flock to either New York or San Francisco because that's where everyone is. It's the network effect of cities.

Cities bring people and ideas together. Ideas spread randomly when you run into peers in coffeeshops or taking the subway. Successful cities like New York and San Francisco invest in the people. They focus on education and industries that compound the skills of its people, like technology and finance.

That's why cities in the Rust Belt like Detroit struggled to survive. Assembly line manufacturing was low skill and not mentally stimulating. It was a knowledge destroying paradigm. They invested in large factories that were more suited for suburbs. They created jobs that didn't attract the brightest individuals.

Bringing people together creates an abundance of opportunity. From finding a new job to starting a business  to rising up the corporate ladder, cities are at the core of all those professional interactions. There is also opportunity in meeting a mate. Among couples where both had a college degree, 50% are located in a city.

Cities also empower people to live greener. Homes and cars account for about 40% of household carbon output, and cities help reduce carbon emissions from both sources.

People travel less miles to get to their destination. Cities are connected via foot, bike or train. The average subway trip emits 0.9 pounds of carbon on average, while the average car trip emits 9 pounds of carbon. Less driving, smaller carbon footprint.

Urban housing is generally smaller. Smaller homes take less heat or air conditioning. The average suburban house consumes 27% more electricity than the average urban household.

Jobs, relationships, and the environment. Cities empower us to live more efficiently.

I hope you enjoyed my first post about cities. I've been fascinated by cities for awhile and finally started doing my own reading to learn more. I'll be writing more posts on cities soon, and these two principles will be foundational concepts in future posts.
