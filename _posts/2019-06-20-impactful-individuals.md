I struggled to find the right words to capture what these four trends describe. Success didn’t feel quite right. It’s often associated with fame, power, or wealth. It means different things to different people, and as Nassim Taleb puts it, a lot of success is a result of randomness.

Fulfillment felt better, but it's hard to judge fulfillment in another person. On the surface, someone with your dream job or the perfect family could feel unfulfilled with their life. Or they could be the happiest person on the planet. You can never be certain, no matter what they say.

The idea I settled with is being an impactful individual. Let’s start by defining impactful. From the Oxford dictionary, impactful means "having a major impact or effect". Let's dig one level deeper and define impact: "the effect or influence of one person, thing, or action on another".

**Being an impactful individual means you are somone who has a major effect on other people, things, or actions.**

This is both broad yet specific at the same time. My parents are both impactful individuals, providing me with strong role models and an environment where I could thrive as I grew up. Many teachers and mentors have impacted my life by fostering my interest in math and science and sparking new interests in other domains. Everyone has the ability to become an impactful individual.

<!-- An impact is meaningful regardless of magnitude or domain; it just means you put the extra effort in to make a difference. -->

Throughout my life, I've noticed several trends in people that I admire. I'll describe these people as highly impactful individuals. While there is no secret formula to success and no equation to feeling fulfillment, I've found four common themes that describe highly impactful individuals. While this list is far from definite and I am by no means someone I'd define as a highly impactful individual, I hope this list is a good starting point to shape your own impact on the world.

#### 1. Read a lot.

> I read myself to sleep every night. I read enormously. I like doing it. Not only that, what I found very early in life was that once I learned to read and handle elementary math, I really didn’t need professors or anything. I could figure out almost anything I wanted better from the written material than from having some professor tell it to me, because he’d be going too fast or too slow or telling me something I already knew or didn’t want to know. And so of course I like doing it by reading.

Of the four trends I will highlight, reading is the most important. Knowledge is the foundation of becoming an impactful individual, and reading is the most efficient way to attain it. It allows us to tap into the collection of human knowledge built up over thousands of years. It opens us to new perspectives and possiblities. It rids us of our ignorance and creates a world possibility.

Many highly impactful individuals are known to be voracious readers. Charlie Munger falls asleep reading every night. Before Elon Musk started SpaceX, he read a rocket science textbook. Mark Zuckerberg's New Year's Resolution in 2015 was to read a new book every two weeks.

Of course reading isn't the only way to learn. Listening to podcasts or watching lecture videos are also great learning resources. But the depth authors can go to through writing and the focus required to read and retain knowledge make reading arguably more effective than more passive methods of learning.

There's no shortcut to learning, and until we can download content into our brain, reading is our bridge to the collective knowledge of humanity.

#### 2. Write a lot.

> In a real essay you're writing for yourself. You're thinking out loud... Just as inviting people over forces you to clean up your apartment, writing something that other people will read forces you to think well.
>
> -*Paul Graham*

If reading is like downloading knowledge, writing is the processing of knowledge. Our minds are kind to us. When we download knowledge, our mind will naturally fill in gaps as we nod along and think everything makes sense.

Just like you can spend all the time in the world reading a textbook on programming or math and not really learn anything until you do the problems, writing challenges everything you just learned from reading books and articles, listening to podcasts, and watching videos. It forces you to fill in the gaps of knowledge and really internalize what you've learned.

Famous venture capitalists like [Paul Graham](http://www.paulgraham.com){:target='_blank'}, [Benedict Evans](https://www.ben-evans.com){:target='_blank'}, and [Naval Ravikant](https://nav.al){:target='_blank'} have shared countless essays that have inspired entrepreneurs with their unique experiences and perspective. Bill Gates writes meticulous [notes](https://www.gatesnotes.com){:target='_blank'} about every book he's read. [David Perell](https://perell.com){:target='_blank'} is a huge advocate for writing as a means of career development, relationship growth, and learning. His goal is to get one thousand people to start writing this year. I am one of those individuals David has inspired.

Writing has compounded my learning. It's forced me to be more critical of what I read, challenge and develop my own beliefs, and learn from the experiences of others.

Anyone can write. We all have a unique perspective to share with the world. You write to find that voice to share that unique perspective with the world, not the other way around.

#### 3. Do work that is not work.

> I’m always working. But it looks like work to them but it feels like play to me. And that’s how know no one can compete with me on it. Because I’m just playing 16 hours a day. And if they want to compete with me and they’re going to work, they’re going to lose because they’re not going to do it 16 hours a day 7 days a week.

When I do a hard set of squats or deadlifts, I'm counting every rep. It feels like the longest thirty seconds of my life. That's work. When I play pickup basketball, time just flows. I don't look at the clock or check my phone - I'm just playing a game. Hours feel like minutes and before I know it, I've spent three hours on the court and my calves are cramping up.

If you find "work" where you can feel this kind of flow, no one can compete with you. Elon Musk slept under his desk when founding his first internet company Zip2. His employees would come in the morning to wake him up and he'd go straight back to "work". This isn't a one time anecdote either. It's happened at X.com (now PayPal), Tesla, and SpaceX. To Elon Musk, this isn't work-he's just playing the game of saving the world.

Your last day of work will be the day you find something you're so passionate about that it feels like play. These are the people that change the world.

#### 4. Synthesize ideas from different fields.

> Creativity is just connecting things. When you ask creative people how they did something, they feel a little guilty because they didn’t really do it, they just saw something. It seemed obvious to them after a while. That’s because they were able to connect experiences they’ve had and synthesize new things. And the reason they were able to do that was that they’ve had more experiences or they have thought more about their experiences than other people. Unfortunately, that’s too rare a commodity. A lot of people in our industry haven’t had very diverse experiences. So they don’t have enough dots to connect, and they end up with very linear solutions without a broad perspective on the problem. The broader one’s understanding of the human experience, the better design we will have.

A lot of us attend our local elementary, middle, and high school and then go off to a college. We graduate and then aspire to do a career in finance, consulting, law, technology, medicine, or academia in New York, San Francisco, Boston, Chicago, Los Angeles, or Washington DC. In a world of infinite possibilites, we've become laser focused on thirty-six paths.

Even though everyone's life experience is different, the variance in these paths is small. If creativity is a result of our experiences, being overly focused on these paths to success leave our minds reading from a playbook.

Highly impactful individuals seek breadth and depth in wide variety of fields. They synthesize ideas from the knowledge they have attained through reading and writing to solve the problems they are facing.

Basecamp founder Jason Fried looks to architecture as a source of inspiration when solving problems at his technology company. Elon Musk has pioneered the electric car, revitalized the space industry, and founded two successful internet companies. Leonardo da Vinci was an artist, engineer, architect, and scientist, curious about learning how and why everything worked.

The final step of becoming a highly impactful individual is synthesizing the diverse ideas you've read, written, and worked on.
