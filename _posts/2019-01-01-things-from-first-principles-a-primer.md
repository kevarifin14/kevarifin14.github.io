*January 1, 2019* By Kevin Arifin

> *"I think it’s important to reason from first principles rather than by analogy. The normal way we conduct our lives is we reason by analogy. [With analogy] we are doing this because it’s like something else that was done, or it is like what other people are doing. [With first principles] you boil things down to the most fundamental truths… and then reason up from there." - Elon Musk*

I've never been one to share my opinion online. In large group chats, Facebook or Reddit posts, even tagging a friend on a meme in Subtle Asian Traits, I am the classic lurker. I even request that others send me a screenshot of the meme rather than tag me in it. While on the surface it's because I don't want others to see me tagged in random memes on their news feed, it's more so because I want to actually have a conversation about the meme if I'm being tagged in it rather than just reacting to it with a like or some witty comment. While the back and forth banter with a friend may just be about how as a former EECS major at Berkeley I actually shower or why my parents decided to name me Kevin just like 5% of the members of Subtle Asian Traits, a converstation that starts with a meme can get surprisingly deep over text versus just replying in a comment thread. 

The goal of this blog is depth. I want to take an idea I've been kicking around in my head or read about in a book, an article, or on Reddit, and break it down to its first principles, just like the words of Elon Musk. His words have shaped my life perspective and influenced the way I see the world and solve problems, and they are now the inspiration for this blog. As a primer for what to expect in future musings, I'll start with the first principles for *Things From First Principles*.

#### 1. Breaking Things Down to First Principles

The name of the blog is intentionally vague so I can write about basically anything. But the focus will taking a topic and breaking it down to its first principles. This involves 

#### 2. Thinking About Perspective

#### 3. Learning and Personal Growth

I am a thinker and usually an over-thinker. My mind is a jumble of words and ideas that rarely mature into legible writing. While it's unlikely that this blog will go big anytime soon, if ever, but just going through the process of internalizing ideas and processing them into constructive sentences is an area of personal growth for myself. Of course, I welcome any feedback on my blog posts and writing - writing is a step out of my comfort zone and I have a lot to learn about the skill. 

<!-- #### 1. Sharing My Perspective

Social media has never been my strong suit. I've always been the last of my friends to sign up for basically every social media account, including Facebook, Snapchat, Twitter, Reddit, and Instagram. While blogging is one of the first forms of social media to exist (and of course I'm late to the game here as well), there is a level of depth and thought behind a blog post that allows readers to glean insight and challenge their own opinions. In a world with so many outlets to share your thoughts, many times I feel like I don't have opinions worth sharing. It's a step outside my comfort zone, but I want to challenge myself to share my own perspective with the world. 

#### 2. Provoking Thought

The best media I've consumed has always made me think and question my life perspective. From my favorite blog posts on [Wait But Why](waitbutwhy.com) (another inspiration for starting my own blog) to some of the most inspiring books like *Quiet* by Susan Cain and *Ender's Game* by Orson Scott Card, pondering the ideas presented changed the way I see the world. While my life experiences are nothing to write a book about, the hope is at least some of the thoughts I share are ideas others can kick around and maybe help develop their own life perspective. Posts will be about a myriad of topics, but will all focus on breaking down a topic to its first principles and drawing conclusions from there.  -->

## The Grand Plan

There is no definitive plan of exactly what I'm going to write about. The name of the blog is intentionally vague so I can write about basically anything. However, in the coming month, I have planned a long post on the subject of in-depth conversations with others and my idea for my monthly recommendation post where I will share my unendorsed opinions on food, restaurants, music, material items, and other things that I'd highly recommend trying. It's a rough roadmap, but I'll take this as it goes, just as I do life.
