I used to play a lot of [Civilization V](https://civilization.com/civilization-5/){:target='_blank'}. For those of you not familiar with the game, Civ is a multiplayer computer game where players take a civilization from prehistoric times to the modern era, competing with each other to achieve world dominance in either science, culture, politics, or military.

In Civ, there is a start setting called strategic balance. Basically, it gives each player an equal amount of horses, oil, and iron at the beginning of the game. Unfortunately, this is not an accurate portrayal of reality. Reality is like a game of Civ with strategic balance turned off and toggled to the other extreme: the vast majority of strategic resources were concentrated in the Eurasian continent.

*Guns, Germs, and Steel* by Jared Diamond explores why the world turned out the way it did. Why did Europe, and not Africa or the Americas, colonize other continents? Why did ideas like capitalism and the scientific theory not thrive in Mexico or sub-Saharan Africa? Jared Diamond's thesis is that environmental factors had a strong impact on the adoption of ideas, and by consequence, the advancement of civilization.

The book is dense. I learned that Zebras were less appealing to domesticate than horses because they have a tendency to bite humans and never let go. I reflected on the challenges of devising writing systems, where communities needed to agree on visible marks to correspond with specific spoken sounds. I read an insane firsthand account of how Pizarro conquered the Incas with only a hundred troops while the Incas had hundreds of thousands of reinforcements.

The details are fascinating, but the big ideas in this book provide an interesting lens to view the world. Here are my two key takeaways from the book.

#### Big Idea #1: Agriculture is the linchpin invention.

No matter if you invented agriculture or adopted it from another civilization, transitioning from hunters and gathers to an agricultural society was essential to freeing up

An interesting perspective was that the idea to switch from hunters and gatherers to agriculture was not that obvious. To us it seems obvious that agriculture is way better than being hunters and gatherers, but in reality, you gave up a lot by switching.

1. Your diet became less diverse. Becoming a fully agricultural society meant you ate only what crops you grew or animals you had domesticated.
2. Agriculture was actually more work. Unless you were able to leverage domesticated large mammals to increase your plowing power, farmers tended fields all day long. Also most of the free time generated was concentrated amongst the wealthy elite.
3. It was also less cool. What's more exciting? Coming home with a giraffe you hunted or tending a field of corn that you'll harvest in three months?
4. There was also a lot of risk to agriculture. A bad crop season could cost you, while hunters and gatherers followed their food around.

So why did anyone ever switch to agriculture? With the right set of factors, it made sense to transition to agriculture. Agriculture allowed for a higher density of individuals to live in proximity. The primary places where agriculture first started like the Fertile Crescent, East China, and the Andes had the highest number of what people called cash crops in combination with large animals able to be domesticated.

Agriculture resulted in compounding advantages. Agriculture allowed a higher density of humans to live in proximity with each other. The high density of human and domesticated animal population made it easier for disease to spread, eventually creating immunity for common diseases that eventually became deadly when Europeans colonized the Americas. High density led to the ability to specialize in certain fields, like military, science, and religion. It forced governments to form to allow peaceful coexistence of people that did not know each other.

The advantages that came from agriculture led to the technological advances that allowed some civilizations to dominate others. Having the right conditions that allowed agricultural societies to build on these advances leads us to our second big takeaway from the book.

#### Big Idea #2: There is an optimal pace that ideas spread.

Both discovering agriculture and building on the civilization that resulted from agriculture depended on the right set of environmental factors. These factors affected the developments of Eurasia, Africa, and the Americas.

In contrast to Eurasia, whose main axis is east to west with moderate terrain barriers, Africa and the Americas face significant terrain barriers like huge mountain ranges and vast desserts and have a north to south main axis. It's not something I ever really thought of, but the effects of the axis orientations of continents had a profound effect on how fast agriculture was able to spread, and thus the advancement of civilization, as we discussed in Big Idea #1.

Agricultural ideas spread from Southwest Asia to Europe, Egypt, and the Indus Valley at a rate of 0.7 miles per year but only 0.2 miles per year from Peru to Ecuador, and 0.3 miles per year from Mexico to the eastern United States.

East-west continents had the advantage of having more consistent temperature along their main axis than north-south continents. Portugal, Iran, and Japan are located at the same latitude 4,000 miles apart but share more similar climate cycles than a location 1,000 miles south. Crops and animals adaptable to that climate would not succeed in a climate 1,000 miles south.

This did not just impact agriculture, but also the spread of ideas between civilizations as well. Writing became an important invention after the transition to agriculture, and a particularly difficult one to develop. There is presumably only two independent inventions of writing: in Sumerian Mesoamerica and Mexican Indians. Other civilizations borrowed ideas from these two civilizations. Lack of land and see barriers, preestablished trade routes, and proximity to other civilizations fostered the transfer of writing as an invention, as well as many other inventions.

We've discussed a lot about the ease in which ideas could be transferred, but it is important to consider the converse as well: is it bad if ideas are too easily to be transferred? The case study that Jared Diamond uses is his comparison of Europe to China.

China has two major rivers running through the heart of their civilization and relatively few land barriers. They unified early and have stayed unified since. Europe in contrast had significant land barriers. This prevented pan-European unification and left them as a series of city-states. This friction against unification actually fostered innovation.

While China was first to many inventions, they stagnated as one decision could make or break the progress of innovation, like not focusing on building fleets of ships. In contrast, Europe innovators could hop around from city-state to city-state, seeking the financial support of a prominent leader, like Christopher Columbus switching allegiances from France to Portugal to Spain before finally colonizing the Americas.

Ideas have to spread at just the right pace. Too fast and a large civilization gets unified and the risk and randomness required for innovation gets stifled. Too slow and you never get the osmosis of ideas from neighbors to develop key inventions like agriculture and writing. These questions of structure are very similar to the concepts Safi Bahcall discusses in his book [*Loonshots*](https://www.amazon.com/Loonshots-Nurture-Diseases-Transform-Industries/dp/1250185963){:target='_blank'}.
