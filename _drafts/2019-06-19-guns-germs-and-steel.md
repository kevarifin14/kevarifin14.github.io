I used to play a lot of Civilization V. For those of you not familiar with the game, Civ is a multiplayer computer game where players take a civilization from prehistoric times to the modern era, competing with each other to achieve world dominance in either science, culture, politics, or military.

In Civ, there is a start setting called strategic balance. Basically, it gives each player an equal amount of horses, oil, and iron at the beginning of the game. Unfortunately, this is not an accurate portrayal of reality.

Reality is like a game of Civ with strategic balance turned off and toggled to the other extreme: the vast majority of strategic resources were isolated to the Eurasian continent.

*Guns, Germs, and Steel* by Jared Diamond explores why the world turned out the way it did. Why did Europe and not Africa or the Americas colonize other continents? What led  Diamond's primary thesis is

The book is dense. I learned more about plants and domesticated animals than I ever thought I would.
I learned the history of groups of people I never knew existed from Khoisan, Polynesians, Australians, Maori. I read an insane firsthand account of how Pizarro conquered the Incas with only a hundred troops while they had hundreds of thousands.

The details are fascinating, but the big ideas in this book provide an interesting lens to view the world.

#### Big Idea #1: Agriculture is the linchpin invention.

No matter if you invented agriculture or adopted it from another civilization, transitioning from an agricultural society was essential to

An interesting perspective was that the idea to switch from hunters and gatherers to agriculture was not that obvious. To us it seems obvious that agriculture is way better than being hunters and gatherers, but in reality, you gave up a lot by switching.

1. Your diet became less diverse. Becoming a fully agricultural society meant you ate only what crops you grew or animals you had domesticated.
2. Agriculture was actually more work. Unless you were royalty, farmers tended fields all day long.
3. It was also less cool. What's more exciting: coming home with a giraffe you hunted or tending a field of corn that you'll harvest in three months?
4. There was also a lot of risk to agriculture. A bad crop season could cost you, while hunters and gatherers followed their food.

So why did anyone ever switch to agriculture? With the right set of factors, it made sense to transition to agriculture. Agriculture allowed for a higher density of individuals to live in proximity. The primary places where agriculture first started like the Fertile Crescent, East China, and the Andes had the highest number of what people called cash crops in combination with large animals able to be domesticated.

Agriculture resulted in compounding advantages. High density of human and domesticated animal population led to the spread of disease, creating immunity for common diseases like syphillis and other blah.

a.       Factors before discovering agriculture: distribution of resources – plants and animals and climate
b.       Factors as a result of agriculture – excess population for innovation, germs, unifications things like government and religion, writing

#### Big Idea #2: Ideas need to be able to spread easily.

In contrast to Eurasia, whose main axis is east to west with moderate terrain barriers, Africa and the Americas face significant terrain barriers like huge mountain ranges and vast desserts and have a north to south main axis.
a. Contrast this with how too easy is also bad in Europe vs Asia

Environmental factors powerful
