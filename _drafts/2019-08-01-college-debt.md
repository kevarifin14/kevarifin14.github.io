The numbers behind student debt are staggering:
* $1.598 trillion in outstanding student loans.
* 49.8 million individuals with student loans.

To put the numbers into perspective, the amount of student debt is greater than the market cap of Amazon, and more individuals have student loans than the population of Spain.

It's a huge problem, and extensive work has been done studying the causes of college debt, which boil down to incentives for college to spend more to increase prestige at the expense of raising tuition and rising administrative costs as a result of these expenditures.

Common solutions include forgiveness of student debt, free college tuition, and alternative ways of paying for college like income share agreements.

This piece focuses on bridging the causes and the solutions: digging into the problem space of student debt and understanding the consequences of student debt. We'll start with a high-level view of the statistics and drill down to understand what the numbers mean. From there, we'll explore a couple interesting anecdotes and relate it to the key problem of student debt: scarcity mindset.

## The Numbers

Who are the 49.8 million people behind the $1.598 trillion in outstanding student loans? Here we have individuals grouped by loan amount outstanding. While most people have loans less than $40,000, a substantial portion of indebted students have more than median household income of $60,000.

For those unfamiliar with the mechanics of a loan, most loans involve a monthly payment where one portion goes toward the amount you owe and the other portion pays off that month's interest. The ranges of monthly payments you would make vary on the amount left you owe. The average outstanding loan amount is about $30,000, which results in a $300 or so monthly payment. To put that into context, leasing the cheapest Tesla Model 3 costs about $390 a month. A loan closer to $100,000 at 2% interest and a 10-year payoff window would incur a monthly payment of $900.

To further emphasize the burden of student loans, debt seems to adversely affect populations of states with struggling economies, like those in the Rust Belt. Let's take a look at the distribution of debt across the United States. Darker colors indicate a higher percentage of the state's population with student debt.

In these regions with struggling economies where cost of living is lower and thus wages are lower, debt affects a larger portion of an individual's finances. For example, average rent in Ohio is about $750. But with a monthly college debt to pay off, it's like increasing your rent by 50% or paying off a Tesla every month, but you get no Tesla.

A large amount of student debt is not on track to be paid off, and this debt sticks around forever. For these individuals, college debt is crippling. There's no way out when you miss a couple payments and the interest starts to compound. It's even tougher when you don't have a sustainable career post-graduation.

## The Stories Behind College Debt

It's essential to understand the individual to understand the problem of college debt. I've always found Reddit to be a reliable source of getting candid personal anecdotes, and with regards to college debt, many people had a lot to share. Here are two stories that particularly piqued my interest.

* [One graduate](https://www.reddit.com/r/legaladvice/comments/9hkc4s/i_stopped_paying_my_student_loans_what_happens_now/){:target='_blank'} was working part-time at a supermarket making $12.50 an hour. He's five years out of graduating college and could not find a job in his field of study. He had stopped paying his loans because he couldn't pay for rent, groceries, and insurance on top of that. Multiple posts indicated he was suicidal.

* [Another couple](https://www.reddit.com/r/legaladvice/comments/9hkc4s/i_stopped_paying_my_student_loans_what_happens_now/){:target='_blank'} owed over $80,000 in student loans and were barely able to make their $900 monthly payment. The wife got a degree in a STEM field, but needed a master's to get well-paying job in her field. Instead of paying off their loans, they decided to live life on the run: frequently moving, not using social media, and switching phones constantly.

These are the stories behind college debt. While they may fall on the extreme end of the spectrum, they represent a shift in mindset from abundance to scarcity. For many individuals, college does not unlock opportunities to a well-paying job and a stable life; it leaves individuals trapped in dead-end careers with no stability.

## Scarcity Mindset

There's nothing wrong with making a monthly payment on a loan you can afford when college unlocks a path to stable job. The problem lies in individuals trapped by college debt and a low-wage job. Debt does not discriminate by the outcome of college, and thus can destroy the opportunities in the future.

A mindset of scarcity, both in terms of money and opportunity, is detrimental to the growth of our communities. Andrew Yang in his book *The War on Normal People* discusses how a mindset of scarcity impairs intelligence and memory, leads to poor health choices, and increases divisiveness and tribalism.

The most important consequence of student loan debt is perpetuating this mindset of scarcity among college graduates. They won't take on the risk of starting a new business because they're paying off the cost of risking their financial future to go to college. They won't start a family or buy a home because they can't save enough money. Scarcity makes the world feel like a zero-sum game, where in reality it's not. Taking risks to leverage our skills creates a positive-sum cycle of wealth creation.

While Silicon Valley and technology get a bad rap, it's a strong example of how abundance leads to new industries and services. Well-paying software engineering jobs in San Francisco and Seattle have sparked a new wave of consumer industries. People spend money on health and fitness through climbing gym memberships or cycling classes. There are services that deliver monthly bottles of algorithmically selected wines and whiskeys or allow you to rent new clothing every month.

Abundance let’s individuals feel comfortable takings risks. Abundance led so many entrepreneurs to the Bay Area during the dot-com bubble. It led Mark Zuckerberg to leave Harvard to work on Facebook. It’s created Google, Facebook, and Apple and catalyzed the creation of more startups trying to innovate.

We’re not done innovating. But if we stifle the . With a $20 trillion dollar GDP, the country has the resources to create an environment where
