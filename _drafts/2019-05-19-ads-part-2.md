excerpt: Think about everything you use that’s free. Google, Facebook, Twitter, maybe Spotify, a handful of articles from the New York Times. It’s hard to get people to spend money. If we can conveniently get something for free, we’ll take it. Advertisements are the driving force behind the free services that we use. At this point, advertisements have become second nature. Want to watch a video on Youtube? Wait five seconds before you can watch. Listening to music on Spotify? Prepare to be bombarded by ads telling you to upgrade. Advertising generates a lot of money. It's a $129 billion market, with Facebook and Google gobbling up 59% of that capital. Starting with the early dot-com companies like Yahoo! and AOL, advertising has been the de facto way to monetize the internet.

            Tech monopolies tend not to fall like Rome. They fall like Venice. They’re still there, and no-one actually invades them, but the trade routes moved, the things that gave them power and wealth stop mattering, and they become just another city, and then a backwater.

1. Users are hesitant to spend money, and prefer a frictionless free service.
2. The incentives of the user and the company are aligned.

Let's refresh our memory by taking a look at the advertising business model.
