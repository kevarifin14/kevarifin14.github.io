In the 1400s, right before the Scientific Revolution, population and land were power. China and the Ottoman Empire were the global leaders in technology. China invented gunpowder, paper, and the compass long before their European counterparts. The Ottoman Empire controlled the overland trade routes between Asia and Europe and extended over three continents (almost 900,000 square miles). They housed scholars that created algebra and algorithms.

In contrast, Europe was stuck in a centuries long dark age. Famine, plague, and war led to a diminishing populations and schisms within the church left Europe fractured.

At that point in history, the Middle East and East Asia were heavy favorites to win the game of civilization. However, Europe would leapfrog both of them in the coming centuries.

Why was Europe, and not the Middle East or East Asia, the heart of the scientific revolution? Small, independent city-states allowed scientists, explorers, and thinkers to move around and find the financial support they needed to pursue their projects. They became a loonshot factory - crazy ideas that any rational person would write off were given a chance by wealthy patrons. Columbus switched allegiances between Portugal, one more place, and finally Spain before setting sail to the Americas. Copernicus

This historical context is important because Europe pre Scientific Revolution mirrors the technology industry today. Google, Apple, Amazon, and Facebook are like China and Ottoman Empires: superpowers who invented the last generation of technology. Wealthy angel investors and VCs sprinkled around the Bay Area and across the country are the independent city-states of Europe. But most importantly, the innovators of today are more empowered than ever to work on loonshots. In my essay The Unbundling of Business, I discuss how pieces of the business are being broken off until the company is left with just its core capabilities. Technologies like AWS, Slack, Zoom, ServiceNow, WeWork, and Twilio allow individuals to be walking big businesses. Not only is there liquid access to capital, but just as scientists and thinkers of the 15th century start working with parchment and ink, entrepreneurs today can build with just a computer and AWS.

Technology has made each of us leveraged superhumans. When you operate in the world of leverage, you are no longer in the world of mediocristan, or normal distribution and extremely rare outliers. You are in the world of extremistan, a world of fat tails and power law returns.
