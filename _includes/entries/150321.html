<h2>Vancouver Adventures</h2>
<h3>March 21, 2015</h3>

<p>
  After more than a month away from the blog, I'm finally back! It's spring break now and to unwind, I've spent a good chunk of time the last 24 hours redesigning my blog and making it more user friendly. It's been a lot of fun and a surprisingly fun way to relax.

  Since it's spring break, my roomates, Nemo and Lewis, and I are taking a trip to Nemo's current residence, Vancouver! It's such a pretty place and I actually really like the city so far. It has a suburban feel similar to my home in Santa Clara, though it's a lot more green, fresh, and rainy. I'll try my best to keep a daily log of our activities. We left yesterday evening at 8:30 pm and we'll be back late on Thursday.

  Today was our rest day from a long semester of working hard and studying for midterms. We all slept in until late, waking up around one. It was a much needed long sleep for a very fun day. Our first item of business was procuring food. We walked about thirty minutes to the nearest Safeway which was also in a shopping mall, where we had breakfast/lunch as well.

  After our first meal of the day, we checked out the shopping mall the Safeway was connected to called Oakridge. We visited a game store where Lewis bought an Assassin's Creed figure. Then we went to the Apple Store and checked out the new MacBook Pro 2015 with the Force Touch trackpad and it was unreal how realistic the feeling was. It actually felt like it had a physical click. We capped off our mall adventure with a visit to the Lego Store, which also makes me nostalgic of my old love for Star Wars legoes. I saw a huge Boba Fett Slave I starship that I really wanted to build but two hundred plus dollars for a lego set is a bit out of my budget. We stopped by Safeway on the way out and went grocery shopping for the first time together! We'll definitely be going a lot together now since we've officially found an apartment for next semester. But that's a story for another time. At Safeway, we bought omelete ingredients, snacks (well mainly a bunch of fruits), and several dinner items for us to cook at home. We took the bus back and just hung around a bit, listening to music, playing games, and working on the website.

  For the rest of the day, we played a bunch of basketball at the local park. It was actually the first time in awhile I played pickup on an outdoor court. I turned my ankle a bit since I was wearing running shoes but it was nothing serious. It was a ton of fun just messing around and playing with some Canadians. We capped basketball with an intense game of HORSE where the loser had to run down and back across the adjacent field in his boxers. The game was tight. I hit a three when Lewis and Nemo both had an S. Nemo, not conventionally known as a good shooter, misses his first, and then hits a clutch second one to put Lewis under a lot of pressure. Lewis misses the first, and I'm stressed too because I want Nemo to lose. Lewis ends up hitting the second and we all go crazy. Unfortunately, Lewis ends up losing the game and has to do the boxer run.

  So that basically sums up our first day! As usual, I'll end with a song that's been stuck in my head all the time recently, the single FourFiveSeconds by Rihanna, Paul McCartney, and Kanye West. Enjoy! Thanks for reading and I'll be sure to keep updating my blog with our daily adventures.
