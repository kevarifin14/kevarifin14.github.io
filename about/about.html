	Welcome to my personal page on the web! I'm a first year Electrical Engineering and Computer Science student at UC Berkeley. I'm originally from the South Bay Area and attended high school Bellarmine College Preparatory.
</p>
<p>
	I'll be sharing some of my thoughts and random insights as well as blogging about my exploits at Berkeley and elsewhere. I'm a fitness freak, working out or playing basketball every day and recently purchased a Misfit to track my progress. I also love playing the guitar, reading, and just spending time outdoors napping on Memorial Glade or walking around town. Food, family, and friends top off my list of favorites and all of these goods of life make me grateful to be alive.
