excerpt: Short build newsletter featuring part 1 of Build Your Own Blog.
---
It's been a busy week revamping some big parts of Edith so I only have time for a quick newsletter featuring my latest [technical blog post on building your own blog](https://kevinarifin.com/blog/build-your-own-blog-1).

Since freshman year of college, I've been hacking around on my personal website and finally started working on consisting publishing a newsletter and blog posts. I originally used [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com) (which is a great place to start learning HTML and CSS!), but I switched to Next during my recent website renovation.

My blog post goes behind the scenes a bit on how I built parts of my own website, so if you've ever considered starting your own blog, I recommend checking it out. Part 1 will get you an ugly looking blog, and I'll release part 2 in before the next build newsletter to go over how to make your blog prettier with Tailwind CSS.

See you next week!

Kevin
