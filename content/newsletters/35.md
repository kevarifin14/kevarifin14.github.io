Happy New Year! I'm sending this a day late so I had time to finish my [2019 Year in Review](/blog/2019-year-in-review).

I found this quote on Reddit the other day and found it inspiring as I start the new year.

Cheers to a 2020 of doing things that spark a light in each of us ðŸ’¥

## [2019 Year in Review](/blog/2019-year-in-review)

![](/blog/2019-year-in-review/heavenly.jpeg)

This is the first year I'm publicly [sharing my reflections for the past year](/blog/2019-year-in-review). 2019 was a year defined by finding my love for learning again. Sharing this blog and newsletter catalyzed a lot of personal and intellectual growth, connected me with a lot of people online and offline, and helped me clarify my own thoughts and opinions.

**By the numbers:**

* Finished 27 books, up from 13 in 2018.
* Sent 34 newsletters and wrote 20 posts.
* Increased my asleep time by 40 minutes and developed a more consistent sleep schedule.
* Only gained 0.74% body fat and 2.78 pounds.

**My goals for 2020:**

* Publish my reading notes
* Grow my newsletter
* Continue my meditation practice

**2019 Favorites:**

Best Meal: Wahaha in Bali

Favorite Weekend: Thanksgiving weekend with Sarah

Favorite City: Chicago

Favorite Sports Moment: Kawhi Leonard series buzzer-beater against the Sixers

Favorite Travel Experience: Day trip exploring Ubud

Favorite Artist: Lauv

You can find the full reflection [here](/blog/2019-year-in-review). I would love to hear your feedback on the newsletter and how I could make it more valuable to you. If you have your own reflections from the year, I would be happy to read it as well!
