excerpt: "The first build newsletter on getting started with Next.js and deploying to production."

As I discussed in [last week's Thought Bytes](https://kevinarifin.com/tb/56), the newsletters will go through a weekly rotation of reflect, build, and learn. This will be the first build-focused newsletter ever and my first time writing a technical post, so bear with me as I work out the kinks.

I took some time to think about how to best structure build-week newsletters. My original thought was to just add the week's post inline in the email, but code blocks look ugly in emails, and you probably won't open an email and start working through a technical post.

I decided to structure the newsletter to be more of a supplemental behind-the-scenes to the post. Build newsletters will go into more depth about the reasoning behind what the featured technical post covers.

This week's post is on [getting started with Next](https://kevinarifin.com/blog/next-from-zero-to-production). By the end of the post, you'll have made a simple change to the default Next app and deployed it to production. You can find the live example [here](https://nextjs-getting-started-chi.vercel.app) and the sample code in [this repository](https://github.com/kevarifin14/nextjs-getting-started).

I started with an end-to-end overview of Next for several reasons:
* Frontend engineering and product design was definitely a weak point of mine as I started Edith. It quickly had to become a strength. If you want to build any product, it's going to need more than a command-line interface or a Jupyter notebook. Figuring out the best way to design that experience and being able to implement and iterate on it with tools like Next is invaluable at a fast-moving startup.
* As a technical co-founder, you may be comfortable navigating a SQL database but not everyone feels that way. Being able to spin up internal tools to access your data in a user-friendly manner is essential, especially if you are working with a non-technical co-founder.
* Production deploys can be frustrating and time-consuming. I spent four days straight trying to piece together a Django-React-Postgres deployment on AWS. In addition, most online technical posts covered how to do specific things in detail, but rarely horizontally integrate all the moving pieces. Understanding the end-to-end process from the start can save you a lot of frustration as you're trying to finish the last 5% to get the product out the door.

This post will be the foundation of several extensions, such as connecting to an Airtable base, creating a personal blog, and starting a mailing list. Hope you enjoy the post and happy to hear any feedback on how I can make these technical write-ups more useful for you!

Have a safe week,

Kevin
