It's been a tough week. Kobe Bryant and his daughter's death shocked me. I'm struggling to put together the words to describe the emotions I felt and continue to feel. Every tribute speaks to his depth of character, love for his family, and unmatched competitiveness and work ethic. Those are the things I will never forget.

Kobe gave 4th grade Kevin a dream and the work ethic to pursue it, and that's something that has stuck with me to this day. As I start my Kobe year, this truly will be a tribute to everything that man has done to inspire not just me, but every basketball fan, parent, and human out there.

<!-- As an 8th grader, I still remember reading the first chapter of basketball book *The Art of a Beautiful Game* on Kobe Bryant and his work ethic over and over. I remember eating pizza with my 8th grade AAU team when Kobe had a tough game to beat the Celtics in game 7, watching his last game scoring 60 points in Soda Hall at Berkeley, and when I heard about his death sitting in a car in Parkside, Iowa. -->

> Those times when you get up early and you work hard, those times when you stay up late and you work hard, those times when you don't feel like working, you're too tired, you don't want to push yourself, but you do it anyway. That is actually the dream. That's the dream.

<!-- A grown man playing basketball made me fall in love with the game of basketball, but it also made me fall in love with working hard and working smart. This is the first time someone famous, someone I didnâ€™t even know, passed away and it almost brought me to tears.

The shadow of Kobe Bryant, his daughter Gianna, and the others on the helicopter loom over my thoughts this week. Life is all too short, and we need to spend as much of it as possible pursuing the things we believe in and with the people we love.

## Davenport, Iowa

![](/newsletters/39/yangiowa.jpeg)


I spent the last week in Davenport, Iowa, and it has been one of the most illuminating experiences of my life. While the main purpose of the trip was to knock on doors and get Iowans to vote for Andrew Yang, the most valuable part of the trip was stepping out of the big city/tech bubble and having conversations with all types of people in the city.

I spoke with Trump supporters, fellow Yang Gang campaign volunteers, political science students on a field trip, felons, and farmers struggling to make a living. Interacting with so many different kinds of people, what's "normal" in the Bay Area and other big cities, is far from normal elsewhere in the country.

The 2 big lessons from the week:

1. Scarcity mindset is real. It's hard to be optimistic, let alone think, about the world if you're working multiple blue collar jobs to survive. Life is literally a trade of time for money and no way of negotiating a better deal. It truly is a privilege to be able to reflect on how to improve your life and have the means to act on it.
2. Connecting the unconnected is extremely hard. We talk about scaling and distribution problems tech startups face, but getting people to go vote makes those problems seem insignificant. If you're on social media, it feels like Andrew Yang's name recognition is close to 100%, yet many Iowans still, many Iowans didn't know his policies like the Freedom Dividend, let alone know who he was. What was encouraging though was of conversations we did have, many were receptive to the message of the campaign. The existing solutions to bringing a campaign from online to offline are knocking on all the doors in the neighborhood and having conversations with random people at a corner store, but it will be interesting to see how the reliance on these manual, unscalable tasks change as more people across the country become more intertwined with social media.

<!-- Canvassing (knocking on people's doors) is hard work, and as an introvert, it made me grateful to have a job that mainly involves using my brain and sitting in front of a computer.

- logistical nightmare - made me realize the internet really gives you superpowers

<!-- Notes on interactions -->

I'll be writing up a post next week with my full reflections of the experience.
