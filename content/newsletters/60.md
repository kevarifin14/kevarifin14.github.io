This week's newsletter features a technical post on using [Airtable as a database](https://kevinarifin.com/blog/airtable-as-a-database). While I definitely don't recommend using Airtable for a more complicated project, it's great to get a prototype off the ground. Three reasons to use Airtable for your next project:

- Connecting to Airtable is easy - no dealing with AWS, connection strings, or IP address whitelisting. Just create an Airtable Base, get an API key and you're good to go.
- Airtable gives you a pre-built interface to view your data. Filters, hiding columns, aggregations - all that good stuff is ready out of the box.
- Added bonus - if you have a non-technical co-founder working with you, Airtable is much more user-friendly than a relational database or document store. This makes it easier for them to help you manage and analyze data you collect.

Recently, I've been building Edith's investor portal and I used Airtable to build the first iteration. Compared to using a relational database on AWS where you have to install pgAdmin to view your data (and you'd have to set up a read-replica of the main database), Airtable made it easy for Nick and I to compile all student and mentor information and build an interface on top of it.

For a super simple project - say custom user input page + a custom view for input data - Airtable is a perfect backend solution. In the post, I walk through building a simple Next app with the Airtable API to input stock tickers you're thinking of buying and selling.

However the downside of using Airtable quickly became apparent. Going back to Edith's investor portal, the app quickly became too complicated. Some annoying things about Airtable:

* A few Airtable limits affect performance and scaling down the line: 1,200 records for the free tier and 5 API calls per second.
* It uses Record IDs as unique identifiers for rows of the table. Record IDs aren't visible in the main Airtable interface which made it sometimes difficult to associate a Record ID and manage joins of data.
* It was hard to model more complex relationships. Without a primary key, joins are inefficient and individual data cells couldn't hold arrays or whole objects like a document store.

I intended the investor portal to be much simpler than it turned out to be, so I ended up doing some work to migrate to MongoDB.

My Airtable experience was far from perfect but helped me build lower-code skillset to quickly building a prototype.

Have a safe week,
