It’s a stressful time to be alive. Coronavirus is kicking into full gear. The stock market saw a drop bigger than any time during both the dot-com bubble and the 2008 financial crisis. I think reality set in for me when the NBA suspended their season. March Madness, among many other large gatherings of people, is canceled as well.

Week one on the startup grind is not as expected but I turn to some advice from Jim Collins book Good to Great that he calls the Stockdale paradox: confront the brutal facts of reality, but have faith in the long term vision. The reality is coronavirus is a serious problem that will have long term economic and social impacts. However, that doesn’t change what we are building in long term. Unfortunately, I didn’t have time to write about what I’m working on and give it the attention it deserves, so I’ll leave that as a forthcoming post.

Anyways, Paul Graham tweeted out a blog post in 2008 titled [Why to Start a Startup in a Bad Economy]( http://www.paulgraham.com/badeconomy.html).
> A recession may not be such a bad time to start a startup. I'm not claiming it's a particularly good time either. The truth is more boring: the state of the economy doesn't matter much either way.

The message is the same: if you believe in your long-term vision, good economy or bad economy, there’s no better time to start a company than now. We’ll see how things play out in the next few months.

Sorry to inundate you with more coronavirus content as I’ve definitely felt like that’s the only thing people are talking about online and offline. Hopefully the rest of this newsletter is a welcome break from that. I share my thoughts on a Sam Altman post, my reading notes for Digital Minimalism, and spotlight why I’m really enjoying the book I’m currently reading, *Kochland*.

## Thought Bit: Sam Altman on How to be Successful

If there's one line from [Sam Altman's article](https://blog.samaltman.com/how-to-be-successful) that you read, it has to be this one:

> A big secret is that you can bend the world to your will a surprising percentage of the time—most people don’t even try, and just accept that things are the way that they are. People have an enormous capacity to make things happen. A combination of self-doubt, giving up too early, and not pushing hard enough prevents most people from ever reaching anywhere near their potential. Ask for what you want. You usually won’t get it, and often the rejection will be painful. But when this works, it works surprisingly well. Almost always, the people who say “I am going to keep going until this works, and no matter what the challenges are I’m going to figure them out”, and mean it, go on to succeed. They are persistent long enough to give themselves a chance for luck to go their way.

I think for most of our lives, we feel at the whim of our surroundings. We go to school and are told what classes to take. We go to work and are told what tasks to accomplish. But really, if you have a clear focus of something you believe in, you can do it if you will it into reality.

While of course a lot of external factors impact your ability to succeed, there is more ownership over your success than sometimes society makes you believe.

Sam Altman talks a lot about leverage in the article: doing things that build your skills and compound over time, working harder and smarter to be more productive, taking risks that lead to high reward. No matter your situation, if you can leverage what you have, you can always get to the next step, and the next, and the next, and finally you've bent reality to what you believe.

This piece is definitely empowering and I highly recommend giving the whole thing a read. You can find the whole article [here](https://blog.samaltman.com/how-to-be-successful)!

## Reading Notes: Digital Minimalism

![](/books/digital-minimalism.jpg)

My 3 takeaways from *Digital Minimalism*:

1. **This book is hard to read.**

    Not in the conventional sense of being boring or poorly written. It’s hard to read because you know a lot of what Cal Newport is saying is true, and you should be making a lot of the changes he suggests to your life. I’d feel bad picking up this book sometimes because it really made me question some of the ways I use technology.

    It felt very much like a Jim Collins’s idea of the Stockdale paradox (confront the facts of reality, but have faith in the big picture) from Good to Great. The facts of reality: my technology habits, both seemingly bad (constant texting, perusing Twitter, Reddit, or ESPN when I’m bored) or seemingly good (texting with old friends, listening to podcasts, reading books), all probably have some detrimental consequences on my well-being, mental health, and productivity. The big picture: improvements to my relationship with technology will lead to drastic improvements in my creativity, mental state, and productivity.

    This book will challenge you to get there. Sometimes hearing that message is hard.

2. **Focus on what’s important.**

    In the book, Newport points out that you wouldn’t be able to build a Facebook or Twitter if you spent all your time on those services. Building these billion dollar businesses involved intense focus that ironically these services make difficult.

    There goes that concept again: focus on what’s important (your declaration, your calling, your hedgehog concept) and cut out the distractions.

3. **I want all my friends to read this book.**

    It’s not an easy book to read. It challenges a lot of what you probably do right now. It probably forces you to face some uncomfortable realizations about how you use your phone. But I think moving from text conversations to Facetime calls, from Instagram stories to paying attention to what’s around you, from going on Reddit or Twitter when a conversation dies down to just saying nothing, relationships will be stronger.

    As humans, we default to what’s easy, whatever takes the least energy. Going on our phones is easy. Sending a text is easy. Unfortunately, developing a true friendship is hard. We can all do better to be present with what’s around us, especially with the people that mean the most to us.

## What I'm Reading

![](/books/kochland.jpg)

The Koch brothers and the oil industry are quite a controversial topic, but I think that's what drew me to the book even more. It's an industry I know nothing about, an opaque company run two of the richest brothers in the world with sketchy histories.

The book starts with an FBI investigation of Koch Industries allegedly stealing oil from Indian reservations by slightly under-measuring the amount of purchased oil. I've gone through a union war and a hostile takeover event by Charles Koch's younger brother Bill.

And I'm not even 1/3 of the way through the book. Excited to see what's next.
