excerpt: Thoughts and lessons from a month and a half of time tracking.

Excited to be back with another Thought Bytes this week after two weeks off. It's been a busy past few weeks with Edith, and I wanted to spend quality time putting this newsletter together.

Over the past month and a half, I've been tracking my time. You can find the genesis of the idea from my [tweet](https://twitter.com/kevarifin/status/1285799581725470720) back in July. In summary, everyone talks about tracking your finances, but no one talks about tracking your time. If time is money, then wouldn't it be important to know how you spend your time? And just like money (but to an even more extreme extent), once you spend time, you can't get it back.

I ended up looping in my brother on the experiment and built a tool we call [Agamotto](https://marvelcinematicuniverse.fandom.com/wiki/Eye_of_Agamotto) (not a link to the tool, but a Wikipedia page) to help us track time. Our barebones time-tracking MVP allowed us to:

- Quickly note down the event just completed (dev work for Edith, hanging out, eating, cooking, etc.).
- Get a daily email report of how you spent time the day before plus a weekly report at the end of the week.
- See a visual representation of how you've spent your time today.

By tracking time, I wanted to get insight on if I was actively spending my time on things that matter to me, whether it's pushing my career forward, growing and learning, or spending time with friends and family. In addition, it's hard to make concrete changes to how I spend my time if I didn't know how I spent it in the first place - budgeting helped me scale back expenses on dining out, alcohol, and expenses. Even just being conscious of how I spend my money (and now my time), makes me more mindful of how I spend my time and money.

There are days when a lot of short 5 minute spurts browsing the Internet adds up to 2 of your 16 waking hours. Here's a snapshot of what one of my unproductive days looks like:

Note the frequent red chunks (non-productive web browsing or TV) and short, frequent events (which means I was pretty unfocused).

Here's what a productive day looks like:

Note the long, focused events and few instances of red chunks.

Time tracking has helped me be conscious about having more productive than unproductive days. Some lessons from time tracking that help me be more productive:

- I'm more conscious about when I multi-task. It's not possible to log multiple types of events at once, so for the sake of tracking, I'm compelled to focus on one thing at a time.
- It feels bad to log a red event. This keeps me off of non-productive web browsing and watching TV (if I do watch TV, I try to do it while eating or exercising).
- If I do log a red event, I make it worth my while. What I mean by that, is if I'm taking a break doing a mindless activity, I focus solely on that, instead of flipping between work and Reddit or writing and YouTube.
- It's useful to know how much time you exactly spend on things a week. Last week, I read a book about 7 hours total, spent 3.5 hours running errands and doing chores, and almost 9 hours watching NBA games or movies. Edith-wise, I spent about 20 hours on dev work (just coding, not including ops stuff or meetings and other things). I can now evaluate my own productivity and effectiveness compared to the features and improvements I delivered.

The app is still in development, but if you're interested in testing out Agamotto when it's beta-ready, shoot me a reply! It's definitely a tough habit to get into (my brother ended up dropping off on time tracking), but I personally find it rewarding to make productive-looking circles and helps me stay mindful about how I spend my time.

I'll cover my thoughts around time tracking in relation to building a startup, especially around effective time management, efficiency, and productivity, in a future Reflect Edition of Thought Bytes.

See you next week ✌️
