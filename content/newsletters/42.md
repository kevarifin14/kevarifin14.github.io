Happy Thursday! I caught the flu this week so that ends my 10+ year streak of never getting a flu shot and never getting the flu. Maybe next year, I'll change my strategy and get a flu shot. I'm still closing my rings (Apple Watch) every day to keep my 140 day streak going.

I'll keep this week's newsletter short so I can catch up on some rest. See you next week ✌️

## [Tesla and the Innovator's Dilemma](https://asia.nikkei.com/Business/Automobiles/Tesla-teardown-finds-electronics-6-years-ahead-of-Toyota-and-VW2)

<!-- I've long admired the work Elon Musk has done at Tesla and continue to be bullish about their prospects. A recent article from Nikkei Business Publications further supports.

One of my favorite lines from the article: "One stunned engineer from a major Japanese automaker examined the computer and declared, 'We cannot do it.'"

What's most interesting about the article is related to my thoughts on *The Innovator's Dilemma* from last week's newsletter.

Tesla -->

A recent article from the Nikkei Asian Review highlighted how Tesla's electronic platform is 6 years ahead of its competitors. Big automakers, however, are not just behind technologically. They are behind because existing supply chains limit their ability to innovate and pursue new tech. From the article:

> The real reason for holding off? Automakers worry that computers like Tesla's will render obsolete the parts supply chains they have cultivated over decades, the engineer said.

This is exactly what Clay Christensen talks about in *The Innovator's Dilemma*. Incumbent companies focused on existing value networks have built processes and supply chains that optimize for value creation on these networks. Disruptors, like Tesla, make these supply chains obsolete.

With Tesla's stock soaring right now, we'll see if they can justify their sky-high valuation. But their technological lead as well as their freedom to innovate makes them the odds on favorite to disrupt the automotive industry.

## [Reading Notes: Shoe Dog](/blog/shoe-dog)

It's been almost a week since I've finished the book, but this line still gets me:
> I’d tell men and women in their midtwenties not to settle for a job or a profession or even a career. Seek a calling. Even if you don’t know what that means, seek it. If you’re following your calling, the fatigues will be easier to bear, the disappointments will be fuel, the highs will be like nothing you’ve felt.

This book is inspiring. The challenges Phil went through to build Nike, the wisdom he shares in the book, and the team he built at the company - honestly the whole book felt like a movie.

My one takeaway from the book: find your calling, and don't stop.

## What I'm Reading

![](/books/good-to-great.jpg)

After Kobe Bryant's unfortunate passing, Bill Simmons did several podcasts reflecting on Kobe's life and his fascination with leadership. At one point, he told an anecdote where Kobe talked about the book *Good to Great* by Jim Collins, saying it was so good that he didn't want other people to find out about it. So of course I had to read the book. My reading notes forthcoming...
