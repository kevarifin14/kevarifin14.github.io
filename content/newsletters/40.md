I'm writing this on a train from New York to D.C. to visit one of my best friends from high school (who recently got into Stanford med!). Sorry I'm two days late with the newsletter, but I needed the time on a quiet train ride to wrap up my essay on my thoughts about Iowa. Read more about it below!

Also this week, I went couch-to-10K and ran the whole loop around Central Park. The dichotomy between city and nature is super awesome and there are some breathtaking views from within the park.

Here's a shot of the New York skyline from the run.

## [How Leverage Divides Us](/blog/leverage)

![](/blog/leverage/iowa.jpg)

It took some time to put my thoughts together on Iowa, but reflecting on my time there helped me better understand why our country is so divided.

Naval talks about 3 types of leverage:
* Labor leverage is people working for you.
* Capital leverage is investing into markets, people, and resources to create more wealth.
* Product leverage is building and using tools to automate tasks and give you superhuman abilities.

These types of leverage are concentrated in big cities and the outputs of leveraged work are reaped by less and less people.

Leverage allows people to save for retirement, have careers with high earnings potential, and plan for the future. Leverage makes you a definite optimist, someone who believes they can directly impact their future.

Leverage is a virtuous cycle because successful nodes attract more investment of labor, capital, and products, which in turn increase the leverage of those nodes.

## What I'm Reading

I feel like every article on tech mentions the late Clay Christensen and his ideas in *Innovator's Dilemma*, so I thought it was about time to read the book. I'm wrapping up the book soon and will write my second 3-2-1 reading note soon.

I highly recommend listening to the [latest Stratechery podcast](https://exponent.fm/episode-180-its-been-a-week/) where Ben Thompson and James Allworth talk about Clay Christensen.

James worked closely with Professor Christensen from his time at Harvard Business School and Professor Christensen called James the smartest student he worked with. It was cool getting a first person perspective on the life of Clay Christensen.
