When I first listened to Andrew Yang on an interview with Sam Harris back in October 2018, I knew he was my candidate. He instantly made me interested in the 2020 Presidential race, but above all, instantly felt like someone who could truly change this country for the better.

The campaign started small. I still remember telling friends about Andrew Yang and getting crickets in response. But slowly he caught on. My brother and I bought “First 500” hats. My friend Wayne became an organizer for Oakland Yang Gang. My girlfriend Sarah donated to his campaign, sent me tweet after tweet about his campaign, and was heartbroken when he dropped out. People were listening.

There was a period of time, where I listened to every single Andrew Yang interview out there. This was before he became too big and was just doing podcast interviews. Sam Harris interview. The big Joe Rogan interview. A conversation with Ben Shaprio. Andrew on the H3 podcast, on Kara Swisher, on the Asian America podcast, Eric Weinstein, Off the Pill (with Niga Higa!). If Andrew was speaking, I had to listen.

I believed in a lot in his policies, the big one being universal basic income, or the Freedom Dividend as he called it. It was such a simple idea, yet would solve a lot of the problems our society faces today.

But continuing to listen to him talk, it went beyond policies. I once reflected on my all-time inspirations list. Elon Musk, Steve Jobs, Kobe Bryant. Andrew Yang skyrocketed up there. I never thought an Asian man running for president would be name-dropped on my list of inspirations.

I never in my life thought I could run for President, but in a weird way, his campaign made me feel like I could do it (not that I would want to). There was something oddly empowering with the way he carried himself as a normal person, pursuing a goal against all odds, and standing up to the establishment with ideas backed by numbers and logic.

So many of Andrew’s qualities are qualities that I aspire to have. I started modeling my public speaking after him. Just as I channel my inner Steph Curry when I shoot, when I speak I channel my inner Andrew Yang. The humanness, the emotion he would show on stage, the love he would share for his family, the entrepreneurial spirit and energy, the attentiveness he would bring to every conversation - those are all qualities I admire and aspire to emulate.

Our country needs Andrew Yang the human. Thank you Andrew for what you’ve started - this is just the beginning.
