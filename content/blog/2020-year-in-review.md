As I go through my morning routine reading the last Stratechery Daily Update of the year, I realize that it’s about time to think about 2020 coming to a close. As crazy of a year as it has been, it’s been a transformative year for me. 

My Kobe year unfortunately coincided with Kobe and Gigi’s passing, but it set the tone for the year. This quote, his message to his daughters at his jersey retirement ceremony in 2017 (three years ago to the day that I’m writing this - December 18th), has remained etched in my mind, and even more so after his passing:

> Those times when you get up early and you work hard, those times when you stay up late and you work hard, those times when you don't feel like working, you're too tired, you don't want to push yourself, but you do it anyway. That is actually the dream. That's the dream.

Three months into 2020, I resigned from Citadel and started working on [Edith](https://edithlabs.com) with my co-founder [Nick](https://nickchua.me). Since then, we’ve helped pair hundreds of students for 1-on-1 mentorship meetings, funded and partnered 8 students (with more on the way) through income share agreements, and raised some venture money. It hasn’t all been easy - there are days I feel incompetent as an engineer, founder, marketer, designer, or any of the many hats you wear as a startup founder. 

But that’s when you wake up early to learn, to work when you’re tired, to push yourself anyways. It’s the journey that’s the reward (as Steve Jobs would say), and it really is the dream. 

It’s about obsession for your craft, and if that’s one thing I’ve learned from listening, reading, and watching the NBA, the best players are the ones that are obsessed with their craft. 

Brief tangent - it’s also the basis of my troll theory that the best players have simple hair. Kobe and Jordan - bald at their peaks. LeBron doesn’t care about his hairline. Steph Curry, until recently, had a simple fade (maybe we can give him a pass since he’s basically been off for over a year). The best players are thinking about basketball, not their hairstyle. 

It’s fitting that Marques Brownlee repeated a similar idea Kobe and being obsessive about learning on JJ Reddick’s podcast that I listened to yesterday: 

> I remember when I was talking to Kobe, the one thing he said that really stuck out was you have no excuse not to learn as much as you can about the one thing that you’re passionate about and want to get into because the information is everywhere.

With that, I wanted to share the three most transformative habits I’ve built this past year that have helped me learn. 

## Time

I started tracking my time back in July because of a simple thought. Time, just like money, is gone when you spend it. But unlike money, you can never get more time. People preach about staying on top of your finances with a diligent budget, yet I've never heard of anyone track how they spend their time.

So I may be crazy, but since then I've been tracking every minute of my life. After everything I do, I log an event which assumes the start is the end of the previous event. I get to color my ring each day — this was a particularly productive day with large chunks of focused time and no wasted time at all.

I’ve also been able to build out cool Sankey charts to see what things I do in sequence. In the chart below, it’s a fight between going on my phone or going straight to my morning routine every morning.

I want to make a public use version of the app (I call it Agamotto after the keeper of the time stone) but it’s been a slog to finish up the last 10% to make it usable to someone besides me. Happy to get some beta testers on soon when I’ve freed up some more time to finish up Agamotto!

## Mornings

> You wake up at 3, train at 4. 4-6. Come home, eat breakfast, relax. Now you're back at it again 9-11. Relax ... Back at it again, 2-4. Now you're back at it again, 7-9. By year 5 & 6, it doesn't matter what kind of work they do in the summer - they're never gonna catch up.

My brother had been trying to talk me into waking up early (like 5:30 a.m. early) for months and I didn’t give in until a random August morning when Sarah and I decided to wake up for sunrise. Since then, I’ve been up early every morning (and a late morning is 8 a.m., a remarkable improvement from waking up in the early afternoon some weekends). 

I wrote a whole [Thought Byte](https://www.kevinarifin.com/tb/61) on waking up early and morning routines so I won’t repeat myself too much, but there are two reasons why I’ve kept up the habit until today:

1. Make time for a routine — I never miss a 200 calorie morning workout, 8 minute meditation, and a Stratechery article every morning. 
2. Sun — Especially on the short winter days, the daylight hours still feel long if you’re up from sunrise to sunset.

## Anki

I wrote a full post on [Anki-ing everything](https://kevinarifin.com/blog/anki-everything) and since then I've continued keeping up the habit of Anki-ing everyday on a morning walk. For those of you unfamiliar with Anki-ing, it's a combination of flashcards + spaced repetition. 

Whether it is having tidbits about what’s going on in tech, politics, or media top of mind during conversations or explaining how things I built work like the process of integrating with a bank account using Plaid and processing payments with Stripe, Anki-ing has helped me be more deliberate about not just consuming knowledge, but retaining it as well. 

## Looking Forward to 2021

It's weird to wrap up the last bit of my 2020 reflection a quarter into 2021 but better late than never. I constantly think of this Chinese proverb whenever I wish I did something earlier:

> The best time to plant a tree was 20 years ago. The second best time is now.

2021 feels like what I've been continuing to build towards over the last few years. 2019 was the foundation — starting to read, write, and build again and rekindling my growth mindset. 2020 was the transition — leaving a corporate job and developing the right habits to build Edith. 

2021 has already been full of long days building, selling, and marketing. We'll see how things come together the rest of the year.
