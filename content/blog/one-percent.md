#### Let's start with a story.

As a chubby fourth grader, I had the profound realization that I couldn't be overweight and play basketball. Inspired by the star players of the time from Kobe Bryant to Dirk Nowitzki, I had dreams of playing in the NBA just like every kid that picks up basketball. Unfortunately that fell short, but the work ethic that came with working toward my dream has stuck with me.

Every day, fourth-grade Kevin, I would do 50 push-ups and 100 sit-ups. I would go to my parents' room, turn on the game on that night and do my nightly routine. Those habits compounded. When I learned to do pull-ups, I set up a pull-up bar under my bedroom door and would do 10 pull-ups every time I walked out of my room. I would eventually go to the park and shoot hundreds of shots a day and do dribbling drills around the house as I watched basketball on TV (thank you Mom for letting me wreak havoc).

Just as I discussed in my post [Identity Challenge](https://kevinarifin.com/identity-challenge), I wanted my identity to be a basketball player and I defined a process around this identity. While the outcome fell short of my aspirations, I made the Varsity basketball team against all odds. Even though I was far from the best player, I continued to work hard and I still love playing and watching basketball to this day.

Little did I know that fourth grade Kevin was building up the atomic habits James Clear talks about in his book. Another of his powerful insights in the book is the idea of getting 1 percent better every day.

We all learn about compound interest in 8th grade math then proceed to forget about it until we are 20 and someone tells us to open a ROTH IRA because if you put in money now, compound interest will make it worth much more when you're allowed to withdraw it.

**The same thing applies to people. If you get 1 percent better every day, by the end of the year you are 38 times better.**

It's just doing the small things every day. I try to grow a little bit every day. You won't see the effects of your investments right away, but over time they pay off in unexpected ways.

The easiest way to do this is to come up with a concrete list of things that you can do every day to improve. While you may not do all of them every day, try to pick at least one, and if you're struggling, the easiest one.

Here's my list of 1 percent activities. I do at least one of these things every day, no matter how busy or tired I am.

1. **Do something active.** From longer workouts like basketball, running, or strength training to small things like doing ab-rollers or pushups, I try to do something active every day. Keeping my body healthy is essential to keeping my mind sharp.
2. **Read a book.** I've been habit-stacking reading everywhere. While I drink my morning smoothie, while I go to the bathroom, before I go to bed, or while I'm in an Uber or train to go somewhere. I sneak reading in as much as possible. As an added bonus, it keeps me off less productive things on my phone like browsing sports websites or social media.
3. **Write.** My weekly writing centers around my Thought Bytes newsletter and up to this point I've sent out more than 10 newsletters and written almost 20 blog posts. A lot of my writing never leaves the ideation stage though. I've found it extremely valuable to write down any random thoughts I have throughout the day in the Notes app, and occasionally look back to trigger my memory.
4. **Meditate**. This is a new one for me. I'm starting to meditate for a minute each day (and hopefully building up from there). Some of my favorite thinkers, including Yuval Noah Harari, Naval, Justin Kan, and Nassim Taleb, are all advocates of meditation. In a world where everyone and everything is fighting for your attention, practicing to control your attention seems like a valuable investment.

If you have any other suggestions, I would love to hear from you. These 1 percent activities won't be the same for everyone so it's up to you to reflect on what matters to you and how you want to grow. But hopefully this gives you a starting point to start compounding yourself.
