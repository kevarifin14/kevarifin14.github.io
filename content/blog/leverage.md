AngelList CEO Naval Ravikant talks about three types of leverage: labor, capital, and product.
* Labor leverage is people working for you.
* Capital leverage is investing into markets, people, and resources to create more wealth.
* Product leverage is building and using tools to automate tasks and give you superhuman abilities.

What’s interesting is that each type of leverage has dominated different points in history.

Labor leverage had been the dominant form of leverage for most of history. The most populous countries, like China, India, and the Ottoman Empire, were the most prosperous. Countries waged wars to grow their empire’s population and put more people to work. Even in the 19th and 20th century, the corporations that employed the most people were the most valuable. But convincing people to work for you either requires fear, a lot of money, or a mission that people believe.

Capital leverage became dominant in the late 20th century, as people developed the concept of financial markets. If you already had a large sum of capital, you could invest it to create more capital. Capital leverage is easier to control than labor leverage because was more flexible and unlike people, you could put your capital to work wherever you wanted.

The 21st century brought the rise of product leverage. Unlike labor leverage which was hard to control and capital leverage which was hard to obtain initially, anyone could develop product leverage by learning to speak the language of the robot army of computers in the cloud.

This basically is the basis of Marc Andreeson’s idea of “software eating the world”. Because labor and capital are expensive in their own ways, developing product leverage is increasingly appealing as companies and people look to increase their bottom line.

This is what has been happening in Davenport, Iowa, a city I recently spent a week in. Deere cut their workforce in half and Caterpillar closed all their factories there. This was also not a single occurrence. 4 million manufacturing jobs across the midwest were lost.

The 21st century has brought about a gradual redistribution of leverage across our country. The economic heart of the United States used to be populous midwest cities centered around manufacturing, but now everyone wants to do six things in six places. From Andrew Yang’s book *A War on Normal People*:

> “Smart people... do one of six things in six places: finance, consulting, law, technology, medicine, or academia in New York, San Francisco, Boston, Chicago, Los Angeles, or Washington DC.”

There is a divide between “big cities” and the rest of America because labor, capital, and products - the tools that give you leverage - are becoming increasingly concentrated in these select regions.

Because leverage allows you to produce outputs greater than the sum of the inputs, businesses can create wealth that is then passed down to the individuals that work there.  When labor was the primary form of leverage, a large number of people reaped small fractions of the benefits. This is what drove economic growth in the midwest.

However, product leverage unlocked higher gross margins by reducing the gross number of people that need to do the labor. With product leverage, you can run a billion dollar company with just 13 people (see Facebook acquisition of Instagram). Many of my friends working in tech or finance are on trajectories to manage large groups of people (labor leverage), save large portions of their salaries for retirement (capital leverage), and work at companies building products with high gross margins (product leverage). Working for high leverage businesses allowed individuals to become highly leveraged as well.

As a leveraged individual, a dollar earned is fifty cents spent, fifty cents saved, and a promise for fifty cents in the future. You make more than you need and have career trajectories that further increase your leverage.

This is in stark contrast to unleveraged individuals. A dollar earned is a dollar spent, with little room for growth in the given career path. It’s hard to worry about the future when your life is focused on making it through the next day.

### Definite Optimism

In Peter Thiel’s book Zero to One, he introduces two axes for thinking about the future: optimistic vs. pessimistic and definite vs. indefinite. Let’s define these axes.

* Optimistic vs. Pessimistic: do you believe the future is going to be better or do you fear the future will be worse?

* Definite vs. Indefinite: do you believe you can make plans to control the future or do you believe the future is out of your control?

Let’s focus on two views of the future: definite optimist and indefinite pessimist. While Thiel’s chart indicates the present United States to be indefinite optimists, I believe the U.S. is divided into two groups based on how leveraged an individual is.

Leveraged individuals are definite optimists. It’s hard not be optimistic when you can invest capital into funds that grow 15% each year, iPhones get smaller bezels and faster processors every year, and companies continue to outcompete each other for engineering talent.

Unleveraged individuals are indefinite pessimists. When one unexpected medical bill, car repair, or traffic ticket could take you into bankruptcy, it’s hard not to be pessimistic about the world.

I had a conversation with a retired farmer from McCausland, Iowa. He told me of many of the challenges of being a farmer. Big agriculture bought up all of the farmland, contracted out work to the local people, and paid them based on the results of the harvest. A bad season was especially challenging for their family.  Regulators made it difficult for independent small farms to raise their own livestock, as they had to meet certain requirements to be sold on the market and have certified vets to inject them with hormones.

What was striking to me though was his apathy towards the situation: “It doesn’t matter to me anymore. My son is a farmer though. He has to deal with it now.”

This was not a one time occurrence. Every individual I talked to in Iowa shared a level of apathy, political disaffection, and hopelessness to improving their situation. But it’s hard to improve the future if you don’t plan for it. And it’s hard to plan for it when you’re unleveraged and focusing on making it through the present.

### Network Effects

> Nodes that are “ahead” get picked more often by the other nodes because they are ahead and thus offer the nodes choosing them less friction and more benefit. When this gets repeated many times, it systematically directs more resources to the nodes that already have relatively more.

This excerpt is from an article on network effects by James Currier, a managing partner of seed-stage venture firm NFX. If it feels like the world is getting more divided, it's because it is. When places full of leveraged individuals like big cites are perceived as “ahead”,  smart people work there, invest there, and build their products there, increasing their leverage even more. This is what I call the leveraged cycle.

Big cities are building a larger and larger lever to lift the world, while the rest of the world is trying to lift the world with their bare hands.

### Rebuilding Leverage

So where do we go from here? I believe it all starts with rebuilding leverage in these presently unleveraged towns. How do we get people, capital, and products to invest in the problems of these towns?

There is a real opportunity here, and it’s not too late to solve it. In the late Clay Christensen’s book *Innovator’s Dilemma*, he talks about how startups operate on a different value network than incumbent companies. We can see this today as startups in San Francisco and New York are solving problems for these places: large-scale enterprise software, scooters and micro-transportation, and a suite of services for millennials.

The people in towns like Davenport live in the problems of their situation. These markets are too small and too distant for incumbent firms to come up with the solutions to solve them, making them ripe for disruption through product leverage.

But doing so requires rebuilding leverage starts by redistributing the value created by product leverage. The transition from labor leverage to product leverage led to resources being concentrated in a smaller population of people. A basic income to redistribute the gains of product leverage rebalances the leverage of the country.

For a town like Davenport, a basic income of $1000 a month for every adult would be a $74 million dollar investment into the city. Giving people a slight bit of leverage shifts their mindset from indefinite pessimist to definite optimist, allowing you to plan for a brighter future.
