<!-- We'll be deploying our Next app using Serverless and AWS Lambda@Edge. If you're not familiar with -->

<!-- [Startup School](https://www.startupschool.org) -->

<!-- If you're using Next 9 with dynamic routes, you'll need to use the latest `serverless-nextjs` plugin.

1. Create a `serverless.yml` file with the following:

    ```bash
    # serverless.yml
    myNextApplication:
      component: "@sls-next/serverless-component"
    ```

2. Make sure your AWS credentials are set in the environment or configured with Serverless.
3. To deploy, simply run:

    ```bash
    serverless
    ```

If you're using AWS Route53 for DNS hosting, it's easy to set up a custom domain in the `serverless.yml`. If not, you probably just want to set up a custom domain in CloudFront.

If you're using Google Domains and want to set up DNS configuration for your CloudFront instance, you'll have to set up a synthetic forward to a subdomain. [Here are some good AWS docs for that.](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/amplify/latest/userguide/to-add-a-custom-domain-managed-by-google-domains.html) -->
