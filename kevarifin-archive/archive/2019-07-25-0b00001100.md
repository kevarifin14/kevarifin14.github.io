I've always imagined the perfect cafe to do work at would have simple, modern furniture and also be lined with bookshelves. I discovered Volumes Book Cafe in Wicker Park a couple weeks ago, and spent some time there this weekend to work on a project and do some reading.

It has ample seating, a reasonable flow of customers to people watch, and a good vibe to do work in. It's so far my favorite cafe in Chicago.

It's been a busy week and I've been focusing more of my reading attention to books, but I have a new post to share, some thoughts on last week's book, and a briefing on my attempt at daily meditation. Hope you enjoy this week's newsletter and see you next Thursday ✌️

## What I Read Last Week

I spent about 4 hours of my Sunday afternoon reading *When Breath Becomes Air* in one sitting, and wow was it powerful. I cried multiple times and spent the rest of the day in a daze reflecting on my life.

One anecdote that really got me thinking was when Paul (already diagnosed with lung cancer) and his wife Lucy were discussing having a child. She asked Paul if it would just make it harder to have to also say goodbye to his kid. He thought about it, and responded with "Isn't that a good thing?"

It made me really think how we sometimes run away from attachment because we preemptively are scared it will bring us suffering. We close ourselves off from our parents or we aren't vulnerable with our friends. But part of life is living and expressing that full gamut of human emotions and developing real human connections with others.

It's hard when it hurts, but when it hurts, you know you've invested a lot in those relationships with family and friends.

## [**One Percent Everyday**](https://kevinarifin.com/one-percent){:target='_blank'}
![](https://kevinarifin.com/images/reflection.jpg)

This [article](https://kevinarifin.com/one-percent) has been in the works for awhile, but I finally shared it. It's inspired from James Clear's [Atomic Habits](https://jamesclear.com/atomic-habits){:target='_blank'} focusing on the process of self-improvement. I wrote about the first step of defining your identity in a previous piece you can find [here](https://kevinarifin.com/identity-challenge){:target='_blank'}.

I write about my process of self-improvement through doing small things every day that compound my learning and growth. I call them "1 percent activities" and it's easiest to do them every day if you define a concrete list. For me I do at least one of reading, writing, working out, or meditating every day. More on meditation in a later section.

If you have any favorite "1 percent activities", I'd would to hear about them!

## [**An Interview with Yuval Noah Harari**](https://www.ted.com/talks/the_ted_interview_yuval_noah_harari_takes_us_into_the_past_and_reveals_the_real_dangers_ahead){:target='_blank'}

I recently finished Yuval Noah Harari's *Homo Deus* and I've greatly enjoyed his work as it blends the problems of today with his deep understanding of history.

One of Yuval's main concepts is the use of myths or stories to tie large numbers of humans together to do amazing things, from going to the moon, working in the company of strangers, or waging wars.

In the podcast, he discusses how a major problem with this century is the lack of a story tying humanity together. The 20th century narrative was a battle between communism, fascism, and liberalism. World War II knocked out fascism and the Cold War eliminated communism.

In the 1970s, there were 130 countries with 30 liberal democracies. Today, nearly every developed country is a liberal democracy, a fact we take for granted.

Yuval argues there is no uniting narrative for today's world. I don't entirely buy it, and it's always easier to add narratives to things farther in hindsight. What are you thoughts on his ideas? Give the podcast a listen and let me know.

## A Brief Aside on Meditation

A lot of my favorite thinkers talk of the benefits of meditation: Naval, Yuval Noah Harari, Nassim Taleb, Justin Kan, Sam Harris, and my brother Andrew. Meditation has always been something I know is probably good for me but never forced myself to start. Well, now I'm starting.

In typical atomic habits nature, I am starting with just showing up: 1 minute of meditation each day. To make it easy to log my meditation, I have a Siri shortcut to automatically start a time and log my meditation. My meditation will be meditation in its purest form: sitting for the allotted time and focusing on my breath.

My goal is to better control my attention and my emotions. If you want to go on this meditation journey, here is a link to my [Siri shortcut](https://www.icloud.com/shortcuts/8d1915400096411389a7575656a3ecb3){:target='_blank'} and I would love to hear how it goes for you!

## What I'm Reading

I read Nassim Taleb's first book *Fooled by Randomness* and really enjoyed it so I thought I'd continue reading the rest of his work. So far, *Black Swan* is even more interesting than his first book.

The premise of the book centers around black swans: a rare, unpredictable event that people generally fail to account for. But black swans are the kinds of situations you want to be in.

Black swans are becoming more common now because humans have created leverage. While a "black swan" in height barely moves the average height of 10,000 normal people, adding Bill Gates, a true black swan of wealth, to 10,000 normal people skews the average drastically.

This leveraging of human society creates situations that are unexplainable if you inductively try to explain your observations. I'm excited to continue reading the book and explore more of these ideas.
