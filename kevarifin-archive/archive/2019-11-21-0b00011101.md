Greetings from Chicago! The weather has definitely gotten chillier, but it surprisingly hasn't bothered me too much as long as the sun is out. It's nice to get back into a routine in the city after a couple weeks of travel and look forward to spending the Thanksgiving holiday in Chicago with Sarah.

Yesterday was also the 5th democratic debate. As a huge supporter of Andrew Yang, I was quite disappointed with his lack of speaking time, and when he did get a chance to speak, he was often asked no-win questions on national security and the trade war.

He still made the most of his limited speaking time, answering in his genuine yet humorous manner.
* On what he'd say to Putin if he won the election: "Sorry I beat your guy."
* His [closing statement](https://youtu.be/6crg579lpds?t=368){:target='_blank'} was especially powerful. "I'm a parent and a patriot and I have seen the future we are leaving for our kids, and it is not something I am willing to accept. We need to create a new way forward for our people... so we can look our kids in the eye and say to them - and believe it - 'Your country loves you, your country values you, and you will be all right'."

On to the rest of the newsletter.

## Thought of the Week

A lot of my thoughts this week centered around mindfulness and meditation. I'm about halfway done with *The Headspace Guide to Meditation and Mindfulness* and it has translated well into my meditation habit, doing a daily two-minute meditation each day this past week. Even with such a short meditation time, I've found myself wanting to meditate as a way to focus myself in the morning or reset my mind after a long day at work.

While meditation is not for everyone, I think everyone can improve at being mindful, and that is an overarching theme in the book. My favorite parts of the book are the anecdotes author and Headspace cofounder Andy Puddicombe shares from his time as a monk. Three have been particularly helpful in my approach to mindfulness.

* **Watching cars on the road**

    Imagine sitting on the side of the road watching the cars go by. These cars are your own thoughts. You could be tempted to try to stop the cars (your thoughts), but that would be counterproductive, if not dangerous.

    Focus instead on sitting on the side of the road and just watching the cars go by. That is the act of meditation. Maybe at some point you'll find a car fascinating and try to chase it, but you'll realize what you're doing and sit back down. This is the process of meditation: watching your own thoughts go by.

* **A cloudy day and blue sky**

    Imagine a moment of pure contentment, when you're so in the moment you have no longing for the past and no worries for the future. This is blue sky. Now imagine a moment of anger or anxiety. This is cloudy sky. But even on a cloudy day, the clouds are just covering the blue sky - it's just a matter of waiting for the clouds to go by. However you are feeling now, it will pass, and you will go back to your baseline of blue sky.

* **Cutting the lawn**

    At a monastery Andy was staying at, the monks asked him to cut the lawn. He went to the shed and was about to take out the lawnmower, but then the monk gave him a pair of scissors. He was to use the scissors to cut the lawn. Andy was fuming, and the whole time while cutting the lawn he was angry at the monk, calculating how much time it would take, and thinking how stupid the exercise was.

    This emotion of anger coated his perception of his experience cutting the lawn. Our experiences are inherently neutral - we coat them with our own emotions. Being aware of our own emotions better allows us to interpret our experiences in a mindful manner.

## [Chamath Palihapitiya](https://www.phocuswire.com/chamath-palihapitiya-virgin-galactic-phocuswright-conference-2019){:target='_blank'}

After featuring a Bill Gates interview last week, I'm sharing an interview with Chamath Palihapitiya, CEO of Social Capital, Chairman of Virgin Galactic, and a part-owner of the Warriors.

He's not as big of a household name as Bill Gates, but shares interesting opinions on the current state of tech, politics, and capitalism in [this interview](https://www.phocuswire.com/chamath-palihapitiya-virgin-galactic-phocuswright-conference-2019).

* **On Google and its transition to find the next big thing**

    Travel companies like Expedia and TripAdvisor were recently hit hard on the stock market because Google's shift towards paid search vs. free search, in addition to Google's continued build out of their own travel platform leveraging Google search.

    Chamath had an interesting perspective on why companies that leverage Google (amongst other big tech companies) as their primary draw for revenue would get hit hard. Google, in its quest to find the next big innovation, is allocating more and more capital to other more R&D focused parts of their business (hence their rebranding as Alphabet).

    This comes at the expense of their earnings, and the only way to maintain strong earnings is to "tax" users of their primary revenue driver, Google search. As this search for the next big thing draws out, Google will have to extract more and more revenue from Google search, at the expense of other business leveraging that platform.

* **On the state of technology and innovation**

    Chamath discusses how we've been in a 40 year period of a monotonic decrease in innovation. We no longer take on grandiose problems like landing a man on the moon to push the limit of technology. Now innovation is left to the big tech companies like Google, Apple, Facebook, and Amazon, and he believes they aren't innovating.

    I don't entirely agree with this as the work Elon Musk has done with Tesla, SpaceX, Hyperloop, and Neuralink are pushing the boundaries of what technology can do today. However, I do agree not enough people are taking big enough risks to truly innovate in today's world.

* **On politics and power**

    Chamath believes the monopoly of the government is power, and they regulate corporate monopolies that threaten their own power monopoly. This means Facebook will be the first to go, since they threaten government power by giving every individual not just in this country, but in every other country, a broadcast platform.

## What I'm Reading

[The Book of Basketball](https://www.amazon.com/Book-Basketball-NBA-According-Sports/dp/0345520106/ref=sr_1_1?keywords=book+of+basketball&qid=1574395694&sr=8-1){:target='_blank'} has actually been sitting on my bookshelf for maybe ten years after I bought the book at a flea market but never cracked open the book.

With Bill Simmons releasing The Book of Basketball Volume 2 in podcast form (links below), I thought I should spend some time reading volume one. As an avid basketball and NBA fan since 2005, reading the book is a true throwback to some childhood memories watching NBA games on TV.

Bill Simmons is truly a professional fan of basketball. Just like the great inventors of our time who started tinkering with Commodore VIC-20s at a young age (Elon Musk), Simmons grew up with prime seats watching Larry Bird in the Boston Garden.

Both the podcast and the book are an embodiment of his life's work, and I recommend any fan of the NBA and basketball to check both out.
