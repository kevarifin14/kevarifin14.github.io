This is my 52nd newsletter, marking a year's worth of newsletters. Thank you for being a part of my journey to grow as a writer, reflect on things I've been working on, and share my thoughts on podcasts, books, and articles I've enjoyed.

Benedict Evans's newsletter is particularly inspiring as I look to continue my newsletter - he's on newsletter 334 so he publish his first newsletter around the time I started college.

I don't have anything particularly special planned for this week's newsletter, but I have plans improve parts of my website as a for-fun project as the amount of posts, newsletters, and reading notes grow.

Thanks again for being a part of Thought Bytes and see you next week ✌️

## Startup Notes

In last week's Startup Notes, I talked about how there's no one to evaluate you when you work on a startup besides the survival of your company. With the lack of clear, day-to-day evaluation, you have to build a strong accountability system for yourself.

Around the time I started Edith full-time, I ran into this article on HackerNews about [someone who used a single .txt file as his sole productivity app](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=22276184){:target='_blank'}.

This article was the inspiration for how I developed my productivity/accountability tool for Edith. While Edith Labs is a 2-person operation, it’s easy to use a single text file to track daily tasks.

Since I started Edith full time, I've been making a daily checklist of tasks in Apple Notes. A brief aside on Apple Notes - contrary to popular opinion, I really like the app. While the shared text-editing isn’t real time, the integration across all my devices is super important for me because I think of things anywhere and I don’t want to be without my notes.

The system I developed is extremely simple: I just add today's date, fill out to do tasks for the day, and copy-paste the previous days incomplete things to today's list. Here's an example from today:

I’ve found several benefits from this.
* It naturally forces me to break down projects into smaller chunks that I feel like I can check off more quickly (hence a feeling of accomplishment). It’s basically a natural flow of product management, taking bigger projects and chunking them into small stories and tasks.
* It forces myself to get small, annoying tasks done. Bugs that I don’t want to take care of, emails I’m too lazy to send - those just become lingering items on my list that I can probably delete quickly.

I've tried various productivity apps, reminders, or paper planners, but so far this has been the best way to keep me accountable with my work.

## [Reading Notes: Nudge](https://kevinarifin.com/reading_notes/nudge){:target='_blank'}

![](https://kevinarifin.com/images/books/nudge.jpg)

This book was quite useful as I had to be thoughtful about how I designed interfaces and defaults on Edith to engage students and mentors.

My one takeaway from the book:

I didn't figure out my one takeaway from *Nudge* until I started reading my next book *The Subtle Art of Not Giving a F\*ck* by Mark Manson. One of the chapters in the book is titled "You're Wrong About Everything". While that may be a bit overdramatic, Manson's point is that the more certain you are of a decision, your identity, or your actions, the less you'll question yourself and you'll end up passing up opportunities to grow and discover more about yourself.

In the context of *Nudge*, many of our actions and decisions are influenced by the context designed by choice architects, the defaults we are given, and the snap reactions of our automatic system overriding our rational reflective system. Many of the decisions we view to be ours, might not even be ours.

So constantly questioning yourself, operating in the mindset that I'm probably wrong, is essential for you to become a choice architect for your own life, design your own defaults, and let your reflective, rational self overcome your automatic self.
