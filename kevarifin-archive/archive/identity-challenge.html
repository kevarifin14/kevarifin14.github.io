        <p>In James Clear’s book <a href="https://jamesclear.com/atomic-habits" target="_blank"><em>Atomic Habits</em></a>, he defines the three layers of behavior change as identity, process, and outcome. Most self-improvement today focuses on outcome-oriented changes: hitting three plates on dead lift, earning a 10% raise, or getting into a relationship. You then focus on a process to achieve this outcome, and before you know it, you are that person you aspired to be.</p>

<p><img src="images/behavior-circle.jpg" alt="" class="img-responsive img-container-center" />
<a href="https://jamesclear.com/atomic-habits" target="_blank"><em>Atomic Habits</em></a></p>

<p><em>Atomic Habits</em> flips this paradigm. Change starts with identity. I am a power lifter. I am a valuable contributor to my team. I am a desirable mate. Through this identity, you focus on the processes that this identity entails, and the outcome comes naturally.</p>

<p>To form this identity, you need evidence. Habits are the building blocks to forming these identities. The more evidence you have supporting each of these identities, the more you come to embody the identity you are or aspire to be. As Clear puts it in <em>Atomic Habits</em>:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The effect of one-off experiences tends to fade away while the effect of habits gets reinforced with time, which means your habits contribute most of the evidence that shapes your identity. In this way, the process of building habits is actually the process of becoming yourself.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>In today’s post, I challenge my own identity, defining who I am, who I aspire to be, and who I don’t want to be.</p>

<p><strong>Who I am</strong> defines the parts of my identity I am happy about, backed by years of good habits.</p>

<p><strong>Who I want to be</strong> defines new parts of my identity I am developing, with habits I am building up so it slowly becomes part of who I am.</p>

<p><strong>Who I don’t want to be</strong> defines the parts of me shaped by years of bad habits, and identitying the process that will change my behavior.</p>

<p>I challenge you to do the same, either in private or shared publicly, in the hope that it motivates you to develop the habits of the person you want to be.</p>

<hr class="post-hr" />

<h2 id="who-i-am">Who I am</h2>

<p><strong>Identity: I am a person who is active and fit.</strong></p>

<p><strong>Evidence</strong>: A lot of people are surprised when I tell them this, but I used to be overweight when I was in fourth grade. Being a chubby asian kid was my identity, but I changed my identity as I picked up basketball in fifth grade and then started lifting weights later in high school. With more than a decade of evidence, being active and fit has been ingrained into my identity. I rarely miss a day of exercise, and even go for runs when I am traveling. I sometimes slip in my diet, but I generally maintain my low-carb, high protein diet. The days I miss my workouts, I don’t feel like myself. It’s a part of my identity that I am very proud of, and a habit that I hope will continue through the rest of my life.</p>

<p><strong>Identity: I am a person who cares deeply about my friends and family.</strong></p>

<p><strong>Evidence</strong>: Like a typical introvert, I don’t have a lot of friends, but the ones I have mean the world to me. Being in Chicago when many of my friends are back home has made it especially difficult, but with my closest friends, I share a couple things that keep us in occasional contact. It’s also helped to have one of my closest friends <a href="https://nickchua.me" target="_blank">Nick</a> living with me in Chicago, where we bounce ideas about our respective blogs and have many insightful discussions about everything from life and relationships to the NBA and Esports. I’ve shed tears with my BEAM rocks as we would all be separated at graduation, traveled all over Asia and Europe with my closest friends, and flown over 10,000 miles home and back to visit my girlfriend. As hard as distance has been with my friends and family, it has given me even more evidence to support my identity as somone who cares deeply about my friends and family.</p>

<hr class="post-hr" />

<h2 id="who-i-want-to-be">Who I want to be</h2>

<p><strong>Identity: I want to be a voracious reader.</strong></p>

<p><strong>Accumulating Evidence</strong>: I’ve always been a bit of a reader since I was young, with my interest waxing and waning throughout the years. Through the years, my nose could always be found buried in a <em>Series of Unfortunate Events</em> book to a <em>Star Wars</em> book to any Orson Scott Card book. My reading tendencies are good foundational building blocks as I look to fill my time with even more reading. I’ve been habit stacking reading everywhere in my day, from drinking my morning smoothie to cooking dinner. Reading is the common link among all the individuals I look up to, from Elon Musk to Warren Buffet to Kobe Bryant, and in terms of directly contributing to my personal growth, becoming a voracious reader is the key area I want to change.</p>

<p><strong>Identity: I want to be someone who is well-versed in personal finance.</strong></p>

<p><strong>Accumulating Evidence</strong>:
I’m glad I listened to my dad told me to contribute to my ROTH IRA after I got my first internship paycheck in 2015. I didn’t really know what he was talking about, but I did it anyways. Fast forward to today, and that portfolio is up 25% or so. I’ve learned the differences between 401k’s, ROTH IRA’s, and IRA’s that I can have a conversation with someone about it. I keep a personal budget, categorizing every expenditure and who I spend it with and track my monthly changes in all my investment accounts. While I am far from being someone you want to get financial advice from, I hope someday to be able to make the sound decisions my dad made to keep create a financially stable family.</p>

<p><strong>Identity: I want to be a strong writer and share my thoughts with the community.</strong></p>

<p><strong>Accumulating Evidence</strong>:
As I’ve grown more confident, I’ve been more open to speaking up and sharing my ideas. Of course, the primary evidence of this identity shift is my work on <em>Life in Bytes</em>. I was terrified when I uploaded my first post, and I still am fearful of judgment when I share a new post. But as my friend Nick puts it, “If no one ever tells you your ideas are dumb, you’ll keep thinking dumb ideas.” Writing has been my phase two of brain growth, synthesizing my thoughts from all the content I’ve consumed in the last several years and continue to consume today. No matter if my blog stays small or somehow explodes in popularity, I will focus always on the process of learning as much as I can, synthesizing the information, and producing high quality content.</p>

<hr class="post-hr" />

<h2 id="who-i-dont-want-to-be">Who I don’t want to be</h2>

<p><strong>Identity: I am someone who is unproductive in the morning</strong></p>

<p><strong>Evidence</strong>:
I can’t imagine how I woke up for school every day at 7:20 a.m. in high school. I even woke up for high school basketball practices at 6 a.m. Now, it takes me about 45 minutes to get out of bed on the weekdays, waking up around 8 a.m. After a couple of snoozes and maybe a scroll through Twitter, I’ll finally roll out of bed and get ready for work. Take away my 45 minute weekday struggle, and that’s four more hours every week. Conversely, I’ve worked for almost a year, and with 200 workdays, that’s almost 150 hours of evidence for being a bad morning person.</p>

<p><strong>Overruling Process</strong>:
It makes me nervous to publicly proclaim things that I will do to become a productive morning person. James Clear has a two minute rule when it comes to forming new habits, basically stating that to form a new habit, the first step has to be really easy. My really easy step will be to take my eye mask off after the first alarm. Hopefully the sun will wake me up and at least push me out of bed. My second easy step will be to read one page of the book I’m currently reading, a little more productive than Twitter yet still forcing me to open my eyes. I will keep <em>Life in Bytes</em> updated about my process in becoming a productive morning person.</p>

<p><strong>Identity: I am someone who is bad at reaching out to old friends</strong></p>

<p><strong>Evidence</strong>:
I have a bad habit of making friends in class or at work, and when that activity ceases, I fail to keep in touch with them. A week goes by and then a month, and by that point, I feel awkward reaching out to them again. Through this bad habit, I’ve lost contact with a lot of the friends I’ve made over the years. While this may seem antithetical to being someone who cares deeply about my close friends and family, I don’t have as much trouble reaching out to my closest friends. With each of my closest friends, I usually build up a shared interest or activity that spans distance, keeping us in touch no matter where we are. I have the ability to maintain relationships, but don’t always put the requisite effort. As time goes by, it’s easy to drift away from friends, so building good habits to maintain relationships is essential.</p>

<p><strong>Overruling Process</strong>:
Keeping with the two minute rule of habit formation, my really easy step to become someone good at reaching out to old friends is to text someone I don’t text on a daily basis. It can be someone easy like any of my close friends, but at least reach out to someone. Habits are hard to break, and this one is a habit I’ve left unchanged for too long.</p>
