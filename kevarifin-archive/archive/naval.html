        <p><a href="https://nav.al" target="_blank">Naval</a>, a prominent internet entrepreneur and founder of Angellist, was recently interview on the Joe Rogan Experience. Joe Rogan brings out the best in his interviewees with his humor and authenticity and there are many thought-provoking ideas disussed in this <a href="http://podcasts.joerogan.net/podcasts/naval-ravikant" target="_blank">podcast</a>. It’s one of the most interesting conversations I’ve ever listened to and immediately gave it a second listen.</p>

<p>During my second listen, every time I heard something that made me think or question something about my life, I wrote it down. It’s a dense, 2 hour podcast and there were 14 moments like that, so, on average, my mind was blown every 8.5 minutes. I’ve aggregated my favorite Naval quotations from the podcast with my own commentary. I’ve added the timestamp for the snippets if you’d like to hear his words in the context of the podcast.</p>

<hr class="post-hr" />

<p><strong><em>[33:00]</em></strong> <strong>High-quality work will be available in a gig fashion. You wake up in the morning, your phone will buzz, and you’ll have five different jobs from people who’ve worked with you in the past or referred you… You decide whether to take the contract or not, the contract is right there on the spot, you get paid a certain amount, you get rated every day or every week, you get the money delivered. And then when you’re done working you turn it off and go to Tahiti or wherever you want.</strong></p>

<p>If you ask ride-share drivers why they like their job, a common answer is they like being their own boss and making their own hours. Imagine this for high-paying, creative jobs like software engineering, writing, and music making. It already exists in the film industry where actors and actresses agree to contract for different films.</p>

<p>Contract work is a result of the personal brand you’ve developed through the quality of your work and the relationships you’ve fostered. We’ll see that this is a recurring theme in a lot of Naval’s thoughts: growing the value of your personal equity and having the freedom to do what you want, where you want, when you want.</p>

<hr class="post-hr" />

<p><strong><em>[33:40]</em></strong> <strong>The information revolution, by making it easier to communicate connect and cooperate, is allowing us to go back to working for ourselves.</strong></p>

<p>This idea is related to my reading in <em>Guns, Germs, and Steel</em>, which focuses on the consequences that resulted from the transition from hunting and gathering to agriculture and industrialization. Hunting and gathering is like working for ourselves, spending the day tracking a pack of animals animal or gathering berries, then bringing our earnings to our tribe.</p>

<p>Agriculture and in particular, industrialization, created a hierarchical labor structure that removed the idea of working for ourselves. This model of centralized labor still continues today, but the information revolution is changing that.</p>

<p>It’s an idea common to some of my favorite thinkers like <a href="https://www.perell.com" target="_blank">David Perell</a>: the internet empowers individuals to create and share their own personal brand. This power allows us to sustainably work for ourselves in modern civilization.</p>

<hr class="post-hr" />

<p><strong><em>[45:30]</em></strong> <strong>Creativity is the last frontier. Automation over a long enough period of time will replace every non-creative work. But that’s great news. That means all of our basic needs are taken care of and what remains for us is to be creative, which is really what every human wants.</strong></p>

<p>There’s a lot of fear that automation will leave lots of people without jobs to do. But I don’t think it’s something we should be afraid of. Easily automated jobs like truck driving or warehouse work are tough jobs. Freeing up human capacity from this type of work will allow us to focus on things that truly make us fulfilled.</p>

<p>When we think about what makes us fulfilled, it’s usually something that is more creative work. The introductory computer science course at Berkeley inspires a lot of students to switch to majoring in Computer Science because it’s probably the first course they’ve taken in their life where they can create something and immediately get feedback about their creation.</p>

<p>It’s the same with careers and life. Whether it’s consuming other people’s creations by watching Netflix or reading a book or creating your own content, like making music or writing, these are the things that make people happiest. If we can redirect more and more of our societal attention to these things, I think the world will be a better place.</p>

<hr class="post-hr" />

<p><strong><em>[48:00]</em></strong> <strong>The correct criticism is when [capitalism] does not provide equal opportunity, but people confuse that with equal outcome. When you have equal outcome that can only be enforced through violence.</strong></p>

<p>During the second Symposium, we discussed this <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/2018/06/the-birth-of-a-new-american-aristocracy/559130/" target="_blank">article</a> from The Atlantic highlighting the growing income inequality in the United States. From making access to premiere education more restrictive, pricing lower-income individuals out of nice neighborhoods, to disparities in health services, income inequality fosters a cycle of monopolizing opportunity to keep privilege in the hands of the privileged.</p>

<!-- <hr class='post-hr'/>

!!!***[1:05:00]*** **What the internet does is creates one giant aggregator for everything... and it creates an atomized long tail of millions and millions of individuals. What it gets rid of is the medium sized ones in the middle.**

The internet makes it both easy to aggregate a lot of content, but also create extremely niche content targeted at specific individuals. This idea is really similar to Alex Danco's idea of [bifurcated distribution](https://alexdanco.com/2015/12/17/taylor-swift-ios-and-the-access-economy-why-the-normal-distribution-is-vanishing/){:target='_blank'}.

In a world with easy access to information and services, there's no room for mediocre. Either you're the best, or you fill a particular niche for loyal followers. -->

<hr class="post-hr" />

<p><strong><em>[1:22:30]</em></strong> <strong>If all of your beliefs line up into one political party, you’re not a clear thinker. If all your beliefs are the same as your neighbors and your friends, you’re not a clear thinker. Your beliefs are socialized; they’re taken from other people.</strong></p>

<p>I had a good conversation about this particular quotation with Nick. We both read a lot of content online, and sometimes when we read work from the expert in a given domain, like Matthew Ball for media or Ben Thompson for tech, we take the perspectives as fact.</p>

<p>I think it’s a good question to reflect upon: what beliefs or perspectives do you have where you are not a clear thinker? Very few issues are binary and most problems don’t have one right answer.</p>

<hr class="post-hr" />

<p><strong><em>[1:23:00]</em></strong> <strong>Now it’s all diseases of abundance. We are over-exposed to everything. So the way to survive in modern society is to be an ascetic; it is to retreat from society. There’s too much society everywhere you go. Society in your pocket, society in your ears. You’re being socialized right now by listening to this podcast. We’re socializing you. We’re programming you. Everyone’s trying to program everybody. The only solution is to turn it off.</strong></p>

<p>I find myself trapped by this abundance every day. There’s always another podcast to listen to, another book to read, another movie to watch. It never ends. While a lot of this content consumption is valuable to learn and expose yourself to different ideas, another part of learning is processing those ideas to form your own opinions.</p>

<hr class="post-hr" />

<p><strong><em>[1:27:00]</em></strong> <strong>Meditation is self therapy. Instead of paying a therapist to sit there and listen to you, you listen to yourself.</strong></p>

<p>If there is one line that could get me to meditate, it’s probably this one. Naval takes a pretty laissez-faire approach to meditation. Just sit there, do nothing, and think.</p>

<p>Think of your mind as an inbox, and if your inbox is full, of course you’re going to be bothered. Sitting and doing nothing allows you to go through and address everything in your mental inbox so you can be your own therapist.</p>

<hr class="post-hr" />

<p><strong><em>[1:34:00]</em></strong> <strong>(With regards to fighting climate change) People are not going to give up economic growth. They’re going to have to get rich first.</strong></p>

<p>This is an interesting perspective on fighting climate change. People don’t care about the environment until you’re in a state of economic prosperity. A recent example is China today, refusing to take in plastic waste imports. As the country is becoming more prosperous, they care more about the environment.</p>

<p>Solving climate change starts with solving the economic problems of individuals, so they can instead shift their attention from an internal focus on improving their own lives to external focus on improving their environment.</p>

<hr class="post-hr" />

<p><strong><em>[1:38:05]</em></strong> <strong>I can sit around and think my thoughts all day long, but a lot of it is going to be nonsense. There are gaps in thinking where you make leaps because you’re kind to yourself that you don’t realize you’re making. But when you’re forced to write it down or have to talk to somebody, you have to complete those gaps and make it a proper logical chain.</strong></p>

<p>I’ve found that thoughts are both full of gaps and ephemeral. Even as I listen to this podcast, I think hundreds of thoughts about every phrase, only to forget them minutes later.</p>

<p>Learning involves work. Extracting meaning from the content others create involves the consumer to create and engage with the content. It’s too easy to listen, read, and think about something and just nod and agree it makes sense and think you’ll remember later. Writing has helped me extract as much learning as possible from the content I consume and the thoughts the come from them, synthesizing my ideas into a logical chain.</p>

<hr class="post-hr" />

<p><strong><em>[1:54:00]</em></strong> <strong>A busy mind can often rob you of peace of mind. Because the peace that we seek is not peace of mind but peace <em>from</em> mind … You’re trying to get out of your own mind. You’re trying to get your monkey mind to stop chattering at you for a moment. You’re trying to get peace <em>from</em> the mind.</strong></p>

<p>I’m someone who always gets trapped in my own thoughts, and I’ve found the best escape for me isn’t forcing my mind to be peaceful, but doing a highly engaging activity that always me to escape from my own mind. From working out to writing to playing basketball, these activites allow me to get peace from my mind.</p>

<hr class="post-hr" />

<p><strong><em>[1:55:50]</em></strong> <strong>Retirement is when you stop sacrificing today for some imaginary tomorrow. When today is complete in and of itself.</strong></p>

<p>These words really spoke to me. Growing up in the Bay Area with high academic pressure from parents and peers, it always feels like today is never enough and you’re always working towards the goals of tomorrow.</p>

<p>Even after graduating from school and finding a job, there always is a better tomorrow that you feel like you need to sacrifice today for. It’s a hard cycle to get out of, but when these feelings are particularly strong, I take a moment to think of the things in the moment that I am grateful for.</p>

<hr class="post-hr" />

<p><strong><em>[2:00:05]</em></strong> <strong>The world just reflects your own feelings back at you. Reality is neutral. Reality has no judgments.</strong></p>

<p>Thinking of the world as neutral is pretty profound. Things just happen and we associate feelings to these events. It’s important to realize these feelings are under our control. Think negatively of everything that happens, and the world feels like a negative place. But if you constantly finding the positive in the things that happen to you, your world view will be happier.</p>

<hr class="post-hr" />

<p><strong><em>[2:07:08]</em></strong> <strong>What you want is a clear mind, so you want to let go of thoughts. Happy thoughts disappear out of your head automatically; it’s very easy to let go of them. Negative thoughts linger. So if you interpret the positive in everything very quickly, you let it go. You let it go much faster.</strong></p>

<p>I know everyone has those super embarassing moments when they were younger where they did something dumb, but looking back it wasn’t so bad. In the moment, it was an extremely negative experience, and it was probably hard to move on. But looking back, you probably now feel it wasn’t that bad at all. But then all the positive moments you had just slip by like middle school graduation or a 5th birthday party.</p>

<p>That’s how I feel negative thoughts are. Those moments attached with strong negative emotions linger, only to the detriment of your present. Naval’s approach to attach positive thoughts that are easy to let go to a negative experience is a great approach to help you let go of “negative” thoughts and keep you grounded in the present.</p>

<hr class="post-hr" />

<p><strong><em>[2:17:00]</em></strong> <strong>I’m always working. But it looks like work to them but it feels like play to me. And that’s how I know no one can compete with me on it. Because I’m just playing 16 hours a day. And if they want to compete with me and they’re going to work, they’re going to lose because they’re not going to do it 16 hours a day 7 days a week.</strong></p>

<p>Through all my readings, there are several overarching trends of successful individuals that I admire. One of the common trends: feeling like work isn’t work. It’s about finding something that’s authentically you and running with it.</p>

<p>To some, it may appear that starting a personal blog or working on projects outside of work is just doing more work. But to me it’s not work; it’s a continuous process of finding things that I am naturally curious about and inspire me to create something tangible.</p>

<p>It’s not an easy thing to find, and I struggle with this often. But this continuous journey to find work that’s not work, that’s so authentically you that no one can compete with you, is one of the great challenges of life.</p>
