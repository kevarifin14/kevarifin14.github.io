Hope everyone is staying healthy during the quarantine. If you need some new quarantine music, the Two Friends released [Big Bootie Mix #17](https://soundcloud.com/bigbootiemix/bb17){:target='_blank'}. They're my favorite DJ group, and the mix is a mash-up of 15-30 second bits of old and new songs of all genres.

I finally finished *Kochland* this week. It was a dense book going through the history of Koch Industries and Charles Koch's role in shaping the company, but gave a unique perspective of how the secretive company was involved in so much of the country's history from labor disputes to policies and legislation. I wanted to spend a little more time digesting the book and typing up my notes, so I'll send them with next week's newsletter.

This week, I'm sharing my thoughts on code vs. no-code from a little experiment I did this week. For those unfamiliar with this debate, no-code is a class of tools that allow you to build websites or apps through user interfaces instead of coding. This lowers the barrier for entry to build various tools and allow individuals to more quickly iterate on their ideas. You can find my full thoughts in the next section. See you next week ✌️

## Thought Bit: Code or No Code

No-code frameworks have gained a lot of popularity over the last year. [Webflow](https://webflow.com){:target='_blank'} is a popular tool to design landing pages and [Glide](https://www.glideapps.com){:target='_blank'} is a tool that allows you to make an app from a Google Sheet.

With the quarantine, Nick and I started doing a home workout I call the Thousand, where you do 100 of various exercises like push-ups, burpees, and squats. I thought this would be cool as an app to keep track of how many you've done of each exercise.

As someone who codes, I was always curious what role no-code solutions would have in industry and how this would change the role of a software engineer. If these no-code solutions make it so easy to build an app or website, what's the point of learning to code?

Making a simple app to track Thousand workouts seemed like a good experiment to understand the pros and cons of no-code, so Nick and I worked on a Glide app together to try to do just that.

We wanted to build a simple app that:
* Allows user to quickly log reps of a certain exercise and add to the daily total
* View the totals for each of the exercises
* View the total reps for the day

Working with Glide to build the app, I felt the limitations of no-code right away. Because Glide uses Sheets as the data store for the app, you are forced to both input and perform operations on the data in Sheets. Two pieces of functionality became immediately unideal:
1. (Bullet 1) Data entry had to be through a form

    Because Glide just adds rows on a Google sheet, we had to enter the data in that format. Our form would select an exercise and then input the additional reps we've done. For example, if we had just done 10 pushups, we'd fill out the form by selecting "Push-ups" from a dropdown and then typing 10. This feels pretty arduous to do for a simple addition to the total count for the day.

2. (Bullets 2 and 3) We had to do a few operations on the Google Sheet to view the data we want.

    The entered data was rows of exercise, the date we did the exercise and the quantity. This isn't the format we want to view the data so we had to process the data a bit. It involved some excel magic like creating a pivot table to get all combinations of date and exercise, and then summing the quantity of the exercise. This leads us to the processed data like below.

    Unfortunately, this still wasn't in the format we wanted. Since Glide reads rows of a table, we couldn't use the pivot table but rather the pivot table unpivoted, where each row was an exercise, date of exercise, and the total reps for that exercise. While this would be fairly easy to do in code with a few for loops, Nick and I googled around and did not find a simple solution to unpivoting the table to get it into a format that Glide could work with.

That was the end of our no-code journey after about 3 hours working on the app. Some thoughts on no-code:
* It's definitely very fast in terms of development. Dragging and dropping different UI components made it really easy to design an interface. There was some learning curve to figuring out which tools were hidden where on the Glide interface, but it's definitely faster than learning how to code.
* However, the low learning curve for using Glide comes at the expense of functionality. There was only one way to enter data and the data had to structured like a spreadsheet. Any additional backend logic would require you to learn some excel. In the given context, summing up the quantities of an exercise for a given day probably would've been faster to learn in Python than wrangling the data in excel.

After the no-code experience, I was curious how it would compare to the code experience, so I decided to go all-code and build the app in React Native, a Javascript framework for mobile apps. Let's remind ourselves the requirements for the app:
* Allows user to quickly log reps of a certain exercise and add to the daily total
* View the totals for each of the exercises
* View the total reps for the day

The interface I imagined was full screens you could swipe left and right between with an exercise and the reps done each day on each screen. You could then tap on the screen to increment the count by 10.

The data would be stored more like a dictionary than individual rows, where I could look up the date and exercise and find my total reps for the day. Incrementing would just update the entry with the exercise for the current day. Here is an example:
```
April 10, 2020: {
    Push-ups: 20,
    Squats: 10,
    Burpees: 0,
    ...
}
```
We could then easily view this data which was already in the format we wanted in a table by tapping on the three dots in the top right corner.

Already we have two advantages over using Glide:
1. We could input data any way we wanted.
2. We could store the data in any way we wanted.

All-code gives us flexibility to interface with data in a way that makes sense for the problem we are working with, at the cost of complexity and the learning curve of learning to code.

Time wise, I spent most of the day completing the app (with a lot of experience in React, the web version of React Native), so all-code is definitely much, much slower in terms of development time. However, all-code allowed me to look at a problem, envision a way of solving it, and implement it in the way I imagined, not just in the structure that Glide allows.

Glide is definitely great to create apps for solving problems that fit the use case of data entry into a Google sheet and displaying data in tabular format. It has an extremely low learning curve and a fast development time. But the flexibility of all-code to design your own interface and data store is superior if you're solving either a more complicated problem or a problem that doesn't fit the particular use cases Glide solves.

In terms of the future of no-code, I think code is still here to stay. No-code is great for solving existing problems and defined use cases, but code is needed to solve new or niche problems. The only way for no-code to solve those problems is to increase it's own complexity and flexibility, taking away from its strength of simplicity.
