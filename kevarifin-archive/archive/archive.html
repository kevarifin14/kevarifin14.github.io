                  Imagine a world where streaming services were fragmented by genre. You could only find animated children’s movies on Disney+, Netflix had all the horror movies, HBO was the king of comedy, and so on. But no one watches just one genre of movie - you’d have to juggle multiple subscription services. Coincidentally enough, this is kind of what’s happening as everyone gets into the streaming video on demand game, but at least a Netflix subscription can satisfy most of your digital entertainment needs.

                  <em>A Brief History of Time</em> by Stephen Hawking was one of the most fascinating books I’ve read. It made me imagine reliving my college experience and studying physics instead of computer science. It left me feeling in awe wondering how the world comes together in a mysterious way at the quantum level and insignificant at the macro level learning how vast the universe is.

                  I used to play a lot of <a href="https://civilization.com/civilization-5/" target="_blank">Civilization V</a>. For those of you not familiar with the game, Civ is a multiplayer computer game where players take a civilization from prehistoric times to the modern era, competing with each other to achieve world dominance in either science, culture, politics, or military.

                  I struggled to find the right words to capture what these four trends describe. Success didn’t feel quite right. It’s often associated with fame, power, or wealth. It means different things to different people, and as Nassim Taleb puts it, a lot of success is a result of randomness.

                  How powerful is your phone? It’s more powerful than the computer that put two men on the moon in 1969. It’s 25,000 times faster than the ENIAC, the first general purpose computer, and that computer covered 1,800 square feet and weighed almost 100,000 tons. The iPhone is about 1.25 square feet and weighs a mere 0.38 pounds, and 5 billion humans over the age of 15 have a mobile phone right in their pocket

                  In James Clear’s book <a href="https://jamesclear.com/atomic-habits" target="_blank"><em>Atomic Habits</em></a>, he defines the three layers of behavior change as identity, process, and outcome. Most self-improvement today focuses on outcome-oriented changes: hitting three plates on dead lift, earning a 10% raise, or getting into a relationship. You then focus on a process to achieve this outcome, and before you know it, you are that person you aspired to be.

                  Think about everything you use that’s free. Google, Facebook, Twitter, maybe Spotify, and a handful of articles from the New York Times. It’s hard to get people to spend money. If we can conveniently get something for free, we’ll take it. Behind each free service we use lies advertising, the key revenue generator of the internet. At this point, advertisements have become second nature. Want to watch a video on Youtube? Wait five seconds before you can watch. Listening to music on Spotify? Prepare to be bombarded by ads telling you to upgrade. Digital advertising generates a lot of money. It’s a $129 billion market, with Facebook and Google gobbling up 59% of that capital. Starting with the early dot-com companies like Yahoo! and AOL, advertising has been the de facto way to monetize the internet. But is advertising really the only way to make money on the internet?

                  I recently finished two books while on vacation: <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Loonshots-Nurture-Diseases-Transform-Industries/dp/1250185963/ref=sr_1_2?keywords=loonshots&amp;qid=1556856545&amp;s=gateway&amp;sr=8-2" target="_blank"><em>Loonshots</em></a> by Safi Bahcall and <a href="https://www.amazon.com/s?k=how+the+internet+happened+by+brian+mccullough&amp;crid=2VMKK73BEFR7I&amp;sprefix=how+the+internet%2Caps%2C135&amp;ref=nb_sb_ss_i_1_16" target="_blank"><em>How the Internet Happened</em></a> by Brian McCullough. I highly recommend reading the two books in tandem, starting with <em>Loonshots</em>. <em>Loonshots</em> gives the framework to analyze the rise and fall of internet companies, as franchise projects like the PC failed to see the rise of the internet and initial internet companies failed to cultivate the appropriate S-type loonshots to make successful businesses (more on what that means later). I’ll cover some key takeaways and how the two books are interconnected in this post.

                  Humans thrive on instant feedback. Fitbit started a national phenomenon by counting steps, encouraging wearers to reach 10,000 steps a day. Apple Watch owners are obsessive about completing their rings. When we know the effects of our actions in a quantitative manner, our behavior changes to the feedback. I’ve been obsessive about data since I was young. As a fifth grader, I would log stats from every workout I did: counting the number of shots made that day, logging reps completed in a 30 second jump rope drill, and tracking the number of free throws I’d hit in a row. Since my second year of college, I’ve religiously tracked my location using Moves (now defunct) and now Arc. I keep a budget of every expenditure and keep a monthly log of the activity on all my financial accounts. Data is the feedback to my life’s actions. It is also a motivator of change.

                  I first seriously thought about the idea of universal basic income last spring while taking Robert Reich’s Wealth and Poverty class my final semester at Berkeley. The class mainly focused on the growing socioeconomic inequality in the country and social policies that could fix the problem. While I agreed the problem was real, the solutions discussed seemed to be antiquated (labor unions), overly complex (earned income tax credit), or had misaligned incentives (disability and welfare programs). This is how I began to formalize the idea of universal basic income in my mind. It appeared to be a simple solution to solve the multitude of problems we face in today’s economy. While I’m no expert in social policy, my continued research of UBI showed it’s not only feasible, but something 2020 democratic presidential candidate Andrew Yang wants to make a reality. I discovered Andrew Yang through an interview he did on Sam Harris’s <a href="https://wakingup.libsyn.com/130-universal-basic-income" target="_blank">podcast</a> <em>Waking Up</em> (now titled <em>Making Sense</em>). While Andrew Yang has many other policies, his most important platform is the Freedom Dividend, which will pay every citizen over the age of 18 $1,000 every month. There’s a lot to understand in terms of implementation and consequences so let’s explore his freedom dividend platform, and see how it makes him the most compelling candidate for president.

                  When I first moved to college, I printed out Ben Jones’s <a href="https://mitadmissions.org/blogs/entry/50_things/" target="_blank"><em>50 Things</em></a> article and pinned it up by my bedside. I would occasionally reread the article and reflect on how I was living my college life. To this day, I still do some of the things on the list like make a playlist for a chapter of my life (number 3). Inspired by his article, I decided to create my own list of things to do and think about while in college based on my experiences in undergrad.

                  Welcome to the first installment of Books I Like. This will be an ongoing series about some of my favorite books and key takeaways from the book. I’ll try to keep the spoilers to the minimum and focus more on why you should check these books out and some things to think about while reading them. You can find my full reading list <a href="/reading-list#books">here</a>. As always, I’m open to new recommendations to add to my reading list!

                  Since graduating in May 2018, I’ve lived and worked in Berkeley, San Francisco, South Bay, Chicago, and New York. I’ve driven across the country and back, visiting Yellowstone, the Arches in Utah, the Grand Tetons, and other national wonders along the way, and also flying the same route across the country another five times. I met the girl of my dreams 3000 miles away from home in New York, who grew up in a house a block a way from the dream home my parents are in the process of building. I left the area that everyone wants to move to and instead took a job in a city where the average population has declined for the past five years. I’ve learned the fundamentals of finance and capital markets, developed tools to study corporate debt, and studied how to algorithmically trade various commodities while working for one of the top firms in the business. I dropped three percent in body fat percentage and proceeded to gain half of it back. I’ve experimented with blockchain and sports gambling, seen my investments rise and fall in a volatile market, and listened to hundreds of hours of podcasts. I’ve felt sad, lonely, and unfulfilled, but also grateful, content, and loved. Through it all, I’ve learned the true value of friendship and how special proximity to friends and family is.
