I heard this Nelson Mandela quotation back in high school and it has stuck with me ever since. Having moved and traveled quite a bit in the past couple years, it is even more resonant as I return to places that were important to me when I was younger, from the Bay Area where I grew up and Indonesia where my family is from.

Going back to Indonesia, even its most touristy destination in Bali, was an unforgettable experience. Having traveled to many countries where I was unable to speak the language, being able to speak Indonesian felt like a superpower.

I was able to connect with the people we met on the trip on a deeper level than on my other trips. From our awesome driver Eka who drove us around Ubud to my favorite hotel attendant Angga, I felt more able to appreciate the culture and the people than any place I'd been before. Language is both a barrier to connection and a beautiful way to connect with people across the world.

During the trip, I tracked our daily movements using an app called [Arc](https://www.bigpaua.com/arcapp){:target='_blank'} so I thought it would be cool to plot the trip and write a couple things about our experience. Find a list of highlights below if you are ever looking for places to check out in Bali!

## Restaurants

**Wahaha**: This place was so good we had to eat here twice. We ordered a feast of pork knuckle, pork belly, pork satay, pork fried rice, pork ribs, mango smoothie, and a fresh coconut. Yes, lots of pig.

**Bali Nikmat**: We ordered pigeon and a fresh fish and even though there were many small bones, the fish was some of the best I've ever had. Eating pigeon was a little weird, but Sarah loved it.

**Mozaic**: The super fancy restaurant of the trip. Someone on Reddit said this was the best meal of their life so we had to try it. While I wouldn't go that far (I still think Wahaha is better), it was a beautiful garden setting with interesting foods like rabbit and rambutan ice cream.

**Bebek Tepi Sawah**: This is a favorite from my mom. The duck is really, really good.

## Places

**Sacred Monkey Forest**: I had a monkey jump on me and try to open my backpack. I had a monkey touch my hand and saw two groups of monkeys fighting over territory. A monkey jumped on top of another swimming monkey and a monkey almost pick-pocketed me. For an immersive experience in the nature of monkeys, this is a great place to visit. Home of the sacred macaque monkeys, they are plentiful and playful and entertained us for several hours as we walked through the forest park.

**Tegallalang Rice Terrace**: We made a quick stop before our dinner reservation to the rice terraces and it was definitely worth it. It was beautiful during golden hour and there's a hiking path that runs through the rice terrace.

**Ubud in general**: It's quite the trek if you're staying in Seminyak or Nusa Dua, but this was probably our favorite and most eventful day of the trip. A driver for the day costs about $50 and they'll take you to all the destinations in and around Ubud. We hit Tegenungan waterfall, the monkey forest, Pasar Ubud (the open-air market in Ubud), Babi Guling Ibu Oka, Seniman Coffee, the rice terraces, and Mozaic all in one day. It was tiring yet memorable experience.

**Rimba**: We spent two nights at the fanciest hotel I've been to in my life. With pristine views of the ocean and forest, a private beach, and a pool that overlooks the ocean, it was a nice little escape from reality. The hotel staff was super friendly and made us feel at home.
