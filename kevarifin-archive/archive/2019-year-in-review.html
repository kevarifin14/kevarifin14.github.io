        <p>A question college students often ask me is “Do you prefer school or work?”. I used to think the two experiences were incomparable, and in many aspects, they still are.</p>

<p>College has a critical density of ambitious people around the same age that facilitates meeting different people and spontaneous hangouts. There’s enough randomness that you’re often forced to make new friends and enough continuity that you develop lasting friendships post-college.</p>

<p>It’s difficult to replicate this environment in the real world. Work is routine. You’re generally around the same set of people on a day-to-day basis, everyone is spread across various neighborhoods and cities, and spontaneity is hard to come by. But with the routine of work, comes a regular chunk of free time from 6 until bedtime and two free weekend days that give you a lot of freedom.</p>

<p>This freedom is what differentiates school and work. This freedom allowed me to read, study, build, and learn exactly what I wanted. No longer were there a set of classes, reading material, and exams to guide your learning. You are your own teacher, instructor, and evaluator. This is both empowering and daunting, but if you spend enough time constructing your personal curriculum, it can be much more rewarding.</p>

<p>The process of creating a personal learning environment helped me grow a lot in 2019. I never thought I’d share my thoughts publicly online, send out a weekly newsletter, and meet random people I met online.</p>

<p>As I start 2020 and my 24th year of existence, I break down my progress I’ve made this year in my reading and writing, the impacts of data collection around my health, and what I’m looking forward to in 2020.</p>

<h3 id="reading">Reading</h3>

<p>Since 2012 (when I read a record 32 books!), I’ve been tracking the books I read each year. But from 2013 to 2018, I read on average 12 books a year.</p>

<p>I made a lot more time to read in 2019, finishing 27 books, up from 13 in 2018. While number of books doesn’t correlate with learning and retaining knowledge, consistently reading has been essential to expose me to new perspectives.</p>

<p>Over the past year, I read many impactful books, but these are the 3 books that had the greatest impact on my life perspective.</p>

<p><img src="/images/atomic-habits.jpg" alt="" class="img-responsive img-container-center" /></p>

<p><em>Atomic Habits</em> was foundational for a lot of the improvement I experienced this year. Everyone wants to make improvements to their life, but James Clear provides both the mindset and simple action steps to make those improvements real.</p>

<p>Clear’s idea of habit stacking (pairing habits you want to develop to habits you already have) helped me sprinkle in reading throughout my day. I habit-stacked reading to various activities I did already, like drinking my breakfast smoothie.</p>

<p>Making the habit as simple as possible and just practicing showing up encouraged me to start a one minute daily meditation that I’ve grown to a three minute daily meditation.</p>

<p>It’s an essential read if you’re trying to make changes heading into the new year. I wrote two posts focused on ideas from the book which you can find below.</p>

<ul>
  <li><a href="https://kevinarifin.com/identity-challenge" target="_blank">Identity Challenge</a></li>
  <li><a href="https://kevinarifin.com/one-percent" target="_blank">One Percent Every Day</a></li>
</ul>

<p><img src="/images/books/theres-no-plan-b-for-your-a-game.jpg" alt="" class="img-responsive img-container-center" /></p>

<p>I thought I worked hard, but Bo Eason takes it to another level. Bo was a scrawny high school kid from the middle of nowhere turned NFL safety. He shares his framework in <em>There’s No Plan B for Your A Game</em> to be the best in what you do.</p>

<p>There really are no secrets. It all starts with a declaration of what you want to be the best in and then creating an environment without distractions that provides the necessary support from your friends and family.</p>

<p>The book provides a unique set of stories from Bo’s experience as an NFL athlete and speaker, including stories from Lauren Holiday (Jrue Holiday’s wife) and Jerry Rice.</p>

<p><img src="/images/books/zero-to-one.jpg" alt="" class="img-responsive img-container-center" /></p>

<p><em>Zero to One</em> is a book of condensed notes from Peter Thiel’s Stanford class on startups. Thiel describes how many ideas as repeating the ideas of the past (going from n to n+1), but truly new ideas go from 0 to 1, a fundamentally different and more difficult process. If you’re going from 0 to 1, you are betting on an important truth that most people probably disagree with you on.</p>

<p>The most powerful aspect of the book is the mindset of someone who want to go from 0 to 1. Thiel defines the term definite optimism as someone who believes they control the improvement of society. Startup founders are definite optimists conspiring to change world.</p>

<h3 id="writing">Writing</h3>

<p>In 2019, I sent 34 newsletters and wrote 20 posts.</p>

<p>Sending out my newsletter every Thursday felt like a capstone to the week, and it’s still crazy to me that I’ve sent out 34 of them. While not all of them were the highest quality, having an obligation to write and share my thoughts each week helped me keep up with reading books and articles and reflecting on my experiences.</p>

<p>My writing fell off at the end of the year, but it’s something I want to do more of in 2020. This thread from <a href="https://twitter.com/andrewchen/status/890076892698750976" target="_blank">Andrew Chen</a> gave me the inspiration I needed to push through and redevelop my writing habit. It was helpful to realize that my writing didn’t necessary have to be original ideas - they could just be backing up my agreement or disagreement through talking with others and my personal reading.</p>

<p>Here are my favorite posts from the year:</p>

<p><a href="https://kevinarifin.com/impactful-individuals" target="_blank"><strong>Four Trends of Impactful Individuals</strong></a></p>

<p>Reading, writing, and being more active on Twitter exposed me to a lot of interesting perspectives from successful founders, VCs, and engineers. This post was the four trends shared by these individuals: reading, writing, doing work that is not work, and synthesizing ideas from different fields.</p>

<p><a href="https://kevinarifin.com/lessons-2019" target="_blank"><strong>Lessons from a Year of Work</strong></a></p>

<p>I reflected on my personal learnings one year after graduation: taking care of life stuff, leveraging and compounding myself, surrounding myself with people I aspire to be like online and in reality, and savoring my 20s.</p>

<p><a href="https://kevinarifin.com/why-im-voting-for-andrew-yang" target="_blank"><strong>Why I’m Voting for Andrew Yang</strong></a></p>

<p>This post is more than just about Andrew Yang’s run for president. It’s a review of the economic impacts of universal basic income, or the Freedom Dividend as Andrew Yang calls it.</p>

<h3 id="health">Health</h3>

<p>This was my first full year tracking a lot of health aspects about my life. Sleep and weight/body fat have been my key performance indicators for my health.</p>

<p><img src="/images/2019-year-in-review/sleep_start.jpg" alt="" class="img-responsive img-third" />
<img src="/images/2019-year-in-review/sleep_mid.jpg" alt="" class="img-responsive img-third" />
<img src="/images/2019-year-in-review/sleep_end.jpg" alt="" class="img-responsive img-third" /></p>

<p>Sleep has always been a poor habit of mine. In college, I regularly woke up past noon and would stay up way past midnight. Measuring my sleep motivated me to both sleep more and sleep at a consistent time. The feedback helped me realize I needed at least 7 hours of sleep and having a consistent sleep cycle increased my productivity and happiness.</p>

<p>In 2019, I increased my asleep time by almost 40 minutes and also went to bed and woke up on a more regular cadence (though I fell off during the holiday).</p>

<p>While it’s tempting to stay up late to do extra work or spend, I’ve found that the irregularity it causes to your sleep cycle and the consequential tiredness is not worth the extra work time at night. I found setting a sleep time around midnight and a wake up time around 8:30 a.m. plus/minus one hour made it easy to have a more regular schedule across weekdays and weekends.</p>

<p><img src="/images/2019-year-in-review/bodyfat.jpg" alt="" class="img-responsive img-half" />
<img src="/images/2019-year-in-review/weight.jpg" alt="" class="img-responsive img-half" /></p>

<p>I started the year near a record-low weight and body fat, and while I did gain a bit of weight, I maintained an active lifestyle with lots of walking, daily workouts, and basketball.</p>

<p>My Apple Watch purchase sparked some new motivation to maintain my active lifestyle. I haven’t missed closing my rings a single day, so hopefully I’ll continue that streak through this year.</p>

<p>I believe a healthy body is conducive of a productive mind. Prioritizing my health has been essential in increasing happiness and productivity.</p>

<h3 id="looking-forward-to-2020">Looking Forward to 2020</h3>

<p>I’m not one for New Year’s resolutions (as Sarah says, you should be trying to improve all year), but the new year is a good time to reflect and identify improvements for the next year. These are three areas of improvement and habits I want to build up in 2020.</p>

<p><strong>Reading notes</strong></p>

<p>It’s easy to read a book and forget what you learned about it. In a similar vein to <a href="https://www.gatesnotes.com" target="_blank">Bill Gates’s blog</a>, I want to share my notes of every book I read this year. This complements well with my hope to write more this year.</p>

<p><strong>Growing my newsletter</strong></p>

<p>I haven’t been as active about publicizing my newsletter recently, but starting the newsletter has been an unexpected way with developing and maintaining relationships with people offline. The goal of growing my newsletter is not just a goal to grow the number of newsletter subscribers, but develop more of these online/offline relationships.</p>

<p><strong>Continue my meditation practice</strong></p>

<p>I’ve been fairly consistent about doing a morning meditation even though I fell off during the holidays. My goal is to maintain my meditation for the year and increase my meditation time from 3 to 10 minutes.</p>
