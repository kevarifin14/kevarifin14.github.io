                    <p>Greetings from the South Bay Area, the last leg of my cross-country journey before heading back to Chicago. I’m back home home for my cousin’s wedding - it’s the first wedding for the youngest generation in my family so it’s an exciting day.</p>

<p>I haven’t been writing as much recently, but I’ve been kicking around a lot of ideas recently. A lot of them are focused around small businesses, risk taking, and innovation which hopefully I’ll synthesize into a couple posts as I free up some time.</p>

<p>This week’s newsletter is health-focused. I share a mini-post about my thoughts on the consequences of positive and negative actions and a NY Times post on how running and swimming affect your heart differently. I also snuck in two not health related but interesting posts I stumbled upon on social media. Next week I’ll be back in Chicago and will also share a couple photos from the adventures these past couple weeks. See you then ✌️</p>

<h2 id="actions-and-externalities">Actions and Externalities</h2>

<p>Travel has been particularly rough for my body clock. All this travel has affected my recent sleep schedule.</p>

<p><img src="https://kevinarifin.com/images/thought_bytes/sleep.jpeg" alt="" class="img-responsive img-container-center" /></p>

<p>The constant tiredness of not having a regular sleep schedule remind me of some thoughts I had about the consequences of positive and negative actions. The consequences of negative actions are much more immediate, while the consequences of positive actions are more externalities. Some examples:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Have a couple drinks and you feel bloated and hungover the next day. Drink water and you feel normal and decrease your chance of liver failure far in the future.</li>
  <li>I put this probiotic supplement called <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Amazing-Grass-Reserve-Superfood-Probiotics/dp/B004TJD72Q" target="_blank">Raw Reserve</a> in my smoothies every morning. I’m not sure if I feel any healthier because of it and I probably won’t know until I’m way older and hopefully feel pretty healthy still. But if I have a pint of ice cream, I immediately feel unhealthy and fat.</li>
  <li>With regards to sleep, when in a stable sleeping routine, you just feel normal, and it has some really good long term health benefits in terms of life expectancy. But a bad night of little sleep leaves you tired and groggy the next morning.</li>
  <li>Working out might be the one exception where the inverse is true: the negative effects of not working out are probably longer term and you feel a lot of benefit right after your workout. It has an extremely high cost (pain and sweat) upfront though.</li>
</ul>

<p>The conclusion seems to be that your body needs a lot of maintenance and is easily affected by negative stimulus. However, our minds aren’t wired to take into account positive externalities very well from sleeping consistently, eating and drinking healthily, and exercising regularly.</p>

<p>The Apple Watch seems to bring a lot of the externality benefits of exercising to the present. By tracking calories burned, heart health, and other metrics, workout numbers are immediate feedback about how exercise helped us. When not exercising, the lack of metrics is an immediate negative feedback loop as well.</p>

<p>I think bringing the positive health externalities to the present would improve the general health of society. Imagine if we had health scores broken down by vitamin levels, proteins, and other metrics, just like a video game. Drinking a smoothie with probiotics would give me a boost in my vitamin levels and drinking water could improve my overall health score, while having a beer would be a big hit to my health score. Sleep could also be scored in the same way (some sleep apps already do this) but in such a way that the feedback is immediate and rewards consistent day-to-day behavior.</p>

<h2 id="heart-health"><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/04/03/well/move/heart-health-swimming-running-exercise.html" target="_blank">Heart Health</a></h2>

<p>I’m excited to get my Apple Watch next week (arriving October 4th) and one of the things I’m most excited about is measuring is my heart health. Last I checked, my resting heart rate hovered around 42 BPM, so we’ll see how much less fit I’ve gotten in the past 3 years.</p>

<p>On the topic of heart health, I read a <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/04/03/well/move/heart-health-swimming-running-exercise.html" target="_blank">NY Times article</a> that highlighted the difference between the heart of a runner and the heart of a swimmer. Athletes in general have larger left ventricles, the part of the heart responsible for pumping oxygenated blood to the rest of the body.</p>

<p>What’s even more interesting is how sensitive the heart is to different types of exercise. Runners in general had more efficient left ventricles because the type of exercise they do (upright running) forces the left ventricle to fight gravity as it pumps blood throughout the body. Swimmers on the other hand still had stronger left ventricles than normal, but the change was not as pronounced since it’s easier to pump blood through a horizontal body.</p>

<p>Our bodies are extremely sensitive to the things we do day-to-day, highlighting just how important it is to keep an active lifestyle. Our bodies adapt to our daily activity habits, and if we’re just chilling all day, the heart will also just chill.</p>

<p><img src="https://kevinarifin.com/images/thought_bytes/moore.png" alt="" class="img-responsive img-container-center" /></p>

<p>Spoiler alert! We’ve actually done a reasonable job competing with Moore’s Law. For those unfamiliar with Moore’s Law, it was an observation made Gordon Moore that the number of transistors on a dense integrated circuit doubles every two years. Surprisingly, technology has kept up with this predictions and it’s exciting to see the race we’ve had against Moore’s law in this <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/dataisbeautiful/comments/cynql1/moores_law_graphed_vs_real_cpus_gpus_1965_2019_oc/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=ios_app" target="_blank">graphic</a>.</p>

<h2 id="phone-on-your-wrist">Phone on Your Wrist</h2>

<p>When they say a phone is on your wrist (if you have an Apple Watch), it’s actually kind of true.</p>
