                    <p>I’ve been thinking a lot about competition recently. By competing, you are inherently doing what everyone else does: applying to the same colleges, fighting for the same classes, recruiting for the same internships, politicking your way to the next promotion.</p>

<p>Will Larson in his book <em>An Elegant Puzzle</em> highlights how you can have the experiences of a manager (positive sum game) without being a manager (zero sum game): making your peers your first team and leading initiatives that others don’t want to take on. You may not be a manager yet, but those are skills you will need when you finally are a manager.</p>

<p>Peter Thiel in <em>Zero to One</em> talks about how everyone preaches competition, yet the more we compete, the less we gain. In the industry, companies that are wildly successful are the ones that create the monopoly: Apple in their ecosystem of consumer products, Tesla in their ecosystem of clean technology, or Amazon in their ecosystem of retail services.</p>

<p>As an individual, Naval talks about superseding competition by creating your own personal monopoly. You are the best at being authentically you. To be authentically you, you have to craft your own experiences and skillset, or as Will Larson would call it, your career narrative.</p>

<p>What are some unconventional ways to escape competition? I would love to hear your thoughts. I’ll be crafting a lot of these ideas into an essay coming soon.</p>

<p>I don’t have a particular recommendation in my weekly shout-out of some of my favorite places in Chicago, but I did want to share a map of my adventures in the city last Saturday. Getting around on foot or public transit, I played basketball at Lincoln Park, did work at two coffeeshops (Limitless and Ipsento 606), and had dinner at Small Cheval in Wicker Park. Chicago is an ideal city to be car-free, and definitely fosters spontaneous adventuring around the different neighborhoods.</p>

<p>Thanks for sticking through the long introduction and being a supporter of my newsletter. I’ll be in California a lot this September. Send me a message if you’re around - I’d love to catch up with anyone in town. See you next week ✌️</p>

<p>If you follow the stock market, then you probably have heard about the yield curve inverting many times the past two weeks.</p>

<p>For those of you not too familiar with what that means, the yield curve inverting means that bonds that last longer periods of time pay you less money than bonds that last a shorter period of time. If long term things pay you less money, then there is less confidence in the future being good.</p>

<p>In the past, it’s been an indicator for a recession, which is why everyone is talking about it (red spike on the graph). But unlike past, everybody knows everything. I don’t have any answers about this impending recession everyone is talking about, but it’s interesting how the market reacts in a world of information abundance instead of scarcity. Dr. Strange did tell Iron Man, “If I tell you, it won’t happen.”</p>

<p><img src="https://kevinarifin.com/images/thought_bytes/storyofus.png" alt="" class="img-responsive img-container-center" /></p>

<p>I’m a huge fan of <a href="https://waitbutwhy.com" target="_blank"><strong>Wait But Why</strong></a>, and they’ve finally released a new series after a year-long hiatus called The Story of Us.</p>

<p>The first post discusses the Primitive Mind vs. the Higher Mind. The Primitive Mind represents our instincts: the desire to eat, sleep, and reproduce, and nothing gets in the way of that. The Higher mind is our intellectual thoughts, constantly fighting for its way. It’s knowing it’s time for bed at 11 p.m., but your Primitive Mind won’t let you because it wants to scroll through Twitter for another 2 hours.</p>

<p>The conflict between Primitive Mind and Higher Mind is the foundation of his series, and defines our individual relationships but also our group relationships as family units or company units.</p>

<p>I have a strong feeling I know where Tim Urban is going to take this series. We as a society have adopted a bunch of technology that empowers our Primitive Mind: constantly picking up our phone to check for notifications, recommendation algorithms pushing us to more extreme content, gated social networks that make us increasingly tribal. We’ll see where Tim will take the series and I’m excited to read more of his insights. Check out the first 3 posts below.</p>

<p>A recommendation from <a href="https://nickchua.me" target="_blank"><strong>Nick</strong></a>, <em>Zero to One</em> is a compilation of notes from Peter Thiel’s entrepreneurship class at Stanford. I found the concepts were very Wait But Why-esque in terms of thinking like a chef rather than a cook - building things up from first principles, superseding the competition by experiencing different things and thinking unconventionally, and thinking of the future as deterministically optimistic.</p>

<p>Thiel shares one of his favorite interview questions in the book: “What important truth do very few people agree with you on?” It’s quite the stumper and left me thinking at my desk for several minutes. The first thought that came to mind is more mainstream now, but using Universal Basic Income as a solution to most socioeconomic inequality issues has been something on my mind since early 2018.</p>

<p>As a second call to action, I would love to hear your answers to the question. It’s not an easy one, but definitely beneficial to ponder.</p>
