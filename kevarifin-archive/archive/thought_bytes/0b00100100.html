                    <p>Happy Friday! A day late with the newsletter because my close friend Cem is visiting me in Chicago. I’m writing this newsletter as we’re relaxing in Electric Mud Coffee Bar, a psychedelic-themed coffeeshop near Wicker Park.</p>

<p><img src="https://kevinarifin.com/images/thought_bytes/electricmud.jpeg" alt="" class="img-responsive img-container-center" /></p>

<p>Last week I celebrated my birthday in California. I went to my favorite Bay Area restaurant China Village with some of my closest friends from high school and college. It was awesome being back home and bringing everyone together for a dinner.</p>

<p>Even while I’m far away in Chicago, these friendships have spanned the distance. Here’s a picture from our dinner!</p>

<p><img src="https://kevinarifin.com/images/thought_bytes/birthdaydinner.jpeg" alt="" class="img-responsive img-container-center" /></p>

<p>If you haven’t checked it out yet, I sent out my <a href="https://kevinarifin.com/2019-year-in-review" target="_blank">2019 Year in Review</a> in last week’s newsletter. It was valuable to reflect on my growth for the past year and look forward to the challenges of 2020. On to this week’s newsletter ✌️</p>

<h2 id="thought-bit-college-applications-as-gatekeepers">Thought Bit: College Applications as Gatekeepers</h2>

<p><img src="https://kevinarifin.com/images/thought_bytes/mehrsa.png" alt="" class="img-responsive img-container-center" /></p>

<p><a href="https://twitter.com/mehrsabaradaran/status/1212153982547714048?s=12" target="_blank">Mehrsa’s Twitter thread</a> presents the ugly side of college admissions. Not only is it financially taxing to apply to colleges, the applications assume a background of privilege. She highlights three challenges her student faced:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Over $1000 of application fees (after waivers)</li>
  <li>Questions focused on theatre productions and concerts</li>
  <li>Questions about what aspects of top schools (like Stanford) excite you</li>
</ul>

<p>Not only are these schools impossibly hard to get into with acceptance rates south of 10%, some students don’t even have access to the requisite experiences that make them attractive candidates.</p>

<p>Opportunity is gated by the privilege of your background. When I was college, I was involved with a science and engineering organization called Berkeley Engineers and Mentors (BEAM). We went to local elementary and middle schools to teach weekly hands-on science and engineering lessons. For many of these kids, this was the only exposure to science and engineering the whole week.</p>

<p>I know I wouldn’t be an engineer today if I didn’t have a dad that pushed me to study engineering and teachers that inspired a love for science. I fell in love with BEAM’s mission because I could potentially be that person for an elementary or middle school student that otherwise may never become a scientist or engineer.</p>

<p>I don’t believe in equal outcome, but I do believe in equal opportunity, and that means reassessing many of the societal gatekeepers of success. Our country is better off when a low-income student from Berkeley can go on to research a cure for cancer or a homeless black student from a rural white neighborhood can lift her life out of poverty by attending an Ivy League school.</p>

<h2 id="the-streaming-war-of-attrition">The Streaming War of Attrition</h2>

<p>From <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2020-01-06/cable-lost-but-streaming-services-aren-t-ready-to-celebrate?srnd=premium" target="_blank">Bloomberg</a> (emphasis mine):</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>No major subscription provider generates reliable profits from streaming video. The king, Netflix Inc., has borrowed $13 billion as the <strong>cash it spends on programming exceeds the fees it gets from subscribers</strong>. (Netflix is profitable on a noncash basis.) Walt Disney Co. says that Hulu, which it took over last year, <strong>won’t turn a profit until 2023 or later</strong>. HBO Max, which is launching this year, is forecast to be <strong>unprofitable through 2024</strong>. By most outsiders’ estimates, Disney+, Prime Video from Amazon.com, CBS All Access, Apple TV+, and YouTube TV aren’t paying for themselves</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Running a streaming video platform is expensive, with even Netflix struggling to turn a profit. However, I believe Netflix still holds an important advantage of being a go-to place to turn on the TV and watch something random.</p>

<p>I’m not the target audience for streaming services as I watch very little TV, but from my experience talking with friends, their response to Disney+ was “This is cool” at first to “I don’t know what to watch anymore”.</p>

<p>Disney+ is more of a means for Disney to build a direct customer relationship. You go on Disney+ to interact with the brand, not to casually kill time watching a TV show. Netflix is focused on being a catch-all for watching TV time, and with its scale, will continue to be the best at doing so, despite increased competition.</p>

<p>I’m not a media expert, but based on the difficulty to turn a profit for streaming services, many will surrender and return to licensing their content to Netflix which continues to be the best demand aggregator for streaming video. However, streaming services that act as a gateway to other services (Apple TV+ with Apple ecosystem, Amazon Prime Video with Amazon Prime, and Disney+ with the Disney universe) will continue to survive.</p>

<p>This visualization from <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/dataisbeautiful/comments/ehd407/oc_chance_of_ending_your_turn_on_each_space_in_a/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=ios_app&amp;utm_name=iossmf" target="_blank">r/dataisbeautiful</a> shows the relative probabilities of landing on each of the squares in a Monopoly game (except Jail which is 2-3 times more likely to land on).</p>

<p>It was generated by simulating 20,000 40-turn games of Monopoly. Might be useful to reference next time you are in a competitive game of Monopoly.</p>

<p><img src="https://kevinarifin.com/images/thought_bytes/socialmediariseandfall.jpeg" alt="" class="img-responsive img-container-center" /></p>

<p>Every social network, even giants like Facebook and Twitter, seem to go through a similar rise and fall in popularity.</p>

<p>Two social networks still on the rise:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Reddit has experienced a nearly 10 year increase in popularity, longer than every other social network on the chart.</li>
  <li>Instagram isn’t far behind with a 7 year rise. It was acquired by Facebook in 2012, before it even makes a blip on the chart. A genius move by Facebook in that moment.</li>
</ul>
