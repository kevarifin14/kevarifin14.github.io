                    <p>Greetings from New York! One of the reasons why the city is so awesome is the random interactions you have with strangers. I met a flight attendant from Holland, a recent New York to SF transplant, and the founder of a boutique software company.</p>

<p>While many of the interactions of ephemeral, I found the randomness to be refreshing, especially since we spend most of our time trapped a digital world algorithmically tailored to what we want to interact with.</p>

<p>If you don’t have time to read my thought bit for this week, I highly recommend checking out the podcast Acquired, which tells stories behind IPOs and acquisitions of big companies. The hosts are VCs/founders themselves and bring a lot of insight to many of these stories. I’ll write more on this in the next section.</p>

<h2 id="thought-bit-company-stories">Thought Bit: Company Stories</h2>

<p>Something I realized I’m lacking is knowing the stories of great companies and founders. As a software engineer with aspirations to drive technological innovation, that felt unacceptable to me. How can you innovate if you don’t understand the context of the industry today?</p>

<p>Reading and listening to these stories feel a lot like watching TV shows. Many follow a typical hero’s journey. Jeff Bezos left a comfortable life at D.E. Shaw to start Amazon in Seattle. Bob Iger went through numerous trials working for a weather company, ABC, ESPN, and Disney before eventually becoming Disney CEO and pioneering their direct-to-consumer distribution push with Disney Plus.</p>

<p>I love hearing the origin stories of these companies and founders because it reminds you not to take their current position for granted.</p>

<p>Hearing about the inspiration and vision these people had is inspiring in its own right, but knowing that each of these individuals was just a normal person is a reminder that anyone can make a meaningful impact on the world.</p>

<p>The book <a href="https://www.amazon.com/How-Internet-Happened-Netscape-iPhone/dp/1631493078" target="_blank"><em>How the Internet Happened</em></a> is a great place to start, as well as <em>The Everything Store</em>, which you can find more details about below.</p>

<p>As I mentioned above, I’ve also been binging the Acquired podcast, where hosts Ben Gilbert and David Rosenthal
talk about the stories behind companies, acquisitions, and IPOs. Here are some thoughts from the first three episodes I listened to.</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p><a href="https://www.acquired.fm/episodes/tiktok" target="_blank"><strong>Tik-Tok</strong></a></p>

    <p>The success of Tik-Tok led Ben and David to differentiate social network (Facebook, Snapchat) from social media (Youtube). They argue that social media seems to have higher short term value, but social networks have longer staying power. Tik-Tok is more akin to social media, as it allows users to create and discover content, so a more apt comparison for Tik-Tok is Youtube.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><a href="https://www.acquired.fm/episodes/disney-plus" target="_blank"><strong>Disney Plus</strong></a></p>

    <p>Bob Iger has worked for Disney or a company that would be owned by Disney for his whole career except 1 year. As a big company, it’s hard to turn away guaranteed revenue through affiliate fees from cable companies, but Iger pioneered Disney’s direct-to-consumer distribution pipeline that culminated in Disney Plus, Hulu, and ESPN Plus.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><a href="https://www.acquired.fm/episodes/sequoia-capital-part-1" target="_blank"><strong>Sequoia Capital</strong></a></p>

    <p>Sequoia is one of greatest VC funds in Silicon Valley yet I know almost nothing about their history. Founded by Don Valentine, they pioneered the venture capital funding and investing model and focused on long-term partnerships with their companies. Fun fact, they sold a super early $150,000 dollar investment in Apple for $6 million dollars!</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<h2 id="reading-notes">Reading Notes</h2>

<p><img src="https://kevinarifin.com/images/books/the-everything-store.jpg" alt="" class="img-responsive img-container-center" /></p>

<p>As I mentioned in my <a href="https://kevinarifin.com/2019-year-in-review" target="_blank">2019 Year in Review</a>, I wanted to start publishing reading notes for every book I read. This is my first set of notes for <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Everything-Store-Jeff-Bezos-Amazon/dp/0316219266" target="_blank"><em>The Everything Store</em></a>, the story of Jeff Bezos and Amazon.</p>

<p>I find it helpful to create a framework for these notes. I’ll be emulating the style of James Clear’s excellent <a href="https://jamesclear.com/3-2-1" target="_blank">3-2-1 newsletter</a>.</p>

<p>Each “reading note” will have 3 ideas, 2 quotes, and 1 takeaway from the book. You can find my notes for <em>The Everything Store</em> <a href="https://kevinarifin.com/reading_notes/the-everything-store" target="_blank">here</a>!</p>

<p>It looks a lot like home…</p>

<h2 id="what-im-reading">What I’m Reading</h2>

<p><img src="https://kevinarifin.com/images/books/design-of-everyday-things.jpg" alt="" class="img-responsive img-container-center" /></p>

<p><a href="https://www.amazon.com/Design-Everyday-Things-Revised-Expanded/dp/0465050654" target="_blank"><em>The Design of Everyday Things</em></a> begins with discussing how engineers approach design with logical explanations, but design is more about understanding people. As an engineer, I definitely feel this struggle. When someone uses something I’ve built, I get nervous as the way they interact with the product is not the way I imagined.</p>

<p>I’ve already started to notice poor designs in the world around me like items with poor feedback mechanisms indicating the success or failure of my action and doors with handles that need to be pushed.</p>

<p>We’ll see how this book changes my mindset on design and hopefully helps me build better products.</p>
