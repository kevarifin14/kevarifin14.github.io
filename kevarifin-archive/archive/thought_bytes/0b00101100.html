                    <p>Happy Friday! Sorry the newsletter is a day late. Today was my last day at Citadel, my first job out of school. I am beyond grateful for the opportunities I’ve had there, but beyond excited for the challenges I have lined up next. More on those in future newsletters. Thank you to the friends who celebrated with me at my favorite Chinese restaurant in Chicago, Grand Palace!</p>

<p><img src="https://kevinarifin.com/images/thought_bytes/44/last-day.jpeg" alt="" class="img-responsive img-container-center" /></p>

<p>I’ve been consuming a lot less online content recently, instead directing more of my attention to reading, which I’ll talk about more in this week’s Thought Bit. I procrastinated a bit with my reading notes, but this week’s newsletter also features my notes for <em>Good to Great</em> and <em>The Ride of a Lifetime</em>.</p>

<p>On to the newsletter!</p>

<hr class="after-post-hr" />

<h2 id="thought-bit-solitude">Thought Bit: Solitude</h2>

<blockquote>
  <p>Solitude requires you to move past reacting to information created by other people and focus instead on your own thoughts and experiences—wherever you happen to be.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I’m going to jump the gun a bit and write a little about some ideas from the book I’m currently reading, <em>Digital Minimalism</em>. The most interesting concept from this book so far has been the idea of our solitude deprivation. Our phones have given us constant and immediate access to articles, social media, and streaming video among other things to fill every moment of boredom.</p>

<p>Basically, we rarely, if ever, experience true solitude anymore, as defined by Cal Newport above. When I first got my Airpods senior year of school, my housemate pointed out that he hadn’t seen me without them on since I got them. On trains, on walks, while waiting in line, people are always looking down at their phones, reacting to information created by other people.</p>

<p>Cal Newport argues that not experiencing solitude is personally detrimental. From the book:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>For one thing, when you avoid solitude, you miss out on the positive things it brings you: the ability to clarify hard problems, to regulate your emotions, to build moral courage, and to strengthen relationships. If you suffer from chronic solitude deprivation, therefore, the quality of your life degrades.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>We’ll see what changes this book will bring to my life. This book has definitely given me a lot to think about with my technology habits. I’ll write more about his ideas like going on a digital detox, journaling, walks, and digital minimalism as I wrap up the book.</p>

<hr class="after-post-hr" />

<h2 id="reading-notes-good-to-great"><a href="https://kevinarifin.com/reading_notes/good-to-great" target="_blank">Reading Notes: Good to Great</a></h2>

<p><img src="https://kevinarifin.com/images/books/good-to-great.jpg" alt="" class="img-responsive img-container-center" /></p>

<p>My one takeaway from the book:</p>

<p>I read this book because on a Bill Simmons podcast remembering Kobe, Simmons tells an anecdote where Kobe found the book <em>Good to Great</em> so valuable that he didn’t want other people to find out about it. I wanted to read the book to find out what he learned from it.</p>

<p>My favorite quote from Kobe I think tells me what this book taught him.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Those times when you get up early and you work hard, those times when you stay up late and you work hard, those times when you don’t feel like working, you’re too tired, you don’t want to push yourself, but you do it anyway. That is actually the dream. That’s the dream.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Going from good to great is falling in love with the process. It’s the small, daily pushes of the flywheel that eventually lead to a breakthrough moment years in the making.</p>

<p>It’s funny - I feel like many of the books I’m reading just keep repeating themselves. The message of Bo Eason’s in <em>There’s No Plan B for Your A Game</em> is to make your declaration to be the best at something specific and just focus on achieving that. Phil Knight’s <em>Shoe Dog</em> is about finding your calling, pursuing it with an athlete’s determination, and just don’t stop.</p>

<p><em>Good to Great</em> is the same. Find your hedgehog concept and build the culture of discipline to focus on things that fall under that hedgehog concept and cut out everything that’s not</p>

<h2 id="reading-notes-the-ride-of-a-lifetime"><a href="https://kevinarifin.com/reading_notes/ride-of-a-lifetime" target="_blank">Reading Notes: The Ride of a Lifetime</a></h2>

<p><img src="https://kevinarifin.com/images/books/ride-of-a-lifetime.jpg" alt="" class="img-responsive img-container-center" /></p>

<p>Bob Iger is an interesting man. He spent his whole career at Disney (and related companies). His tenure at Disney brought the acquisition of Pixar, Marvel, and Lucasfilm. He was close friends with Steve Jobs.</p>

<p>One of my favorite quotes from the book is related to the idea of solitude I discussed in this week’s Thought Bit. Makes me think I should also wake up early.</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>To this day, I wake nearly every morning at four-fifteen, though now I do it for selfish reasons: to have time to think and read and exercise before the demands of the day take over. Those hours aren’t for everyone, but however you find the time, it’s vital to create space in each day to let your thoughts wander beyond your immediate job responsibilities, to turn things over in your mind in a less pressured, more creative way than is possible once the daily triage kicks in. I’ve come to cherish that time alone each morning, and am certain I’d be less productive and less creative in my work if I didn’t also spend those first hours away from the emails and text messages and phone calls that require so much attention as the day goes on.</p>
