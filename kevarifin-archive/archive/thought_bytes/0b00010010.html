                    <p>I’ve spent the last week in California. Every time I’m back, I struggle with the car-first design of the Bay Area. While the SF Bay Area covers a large area of land, the poor design of the cities exacerbates the problems of non-car methods of transit.</p>

<p>Mixed-use residential and commercial properties are extremely rare in the South Bay, and even new developments are not all mixed-use properties. There is a slight chicken-egg problem here where mixed-use developments are much more commercially viable in a pedestrian-first city because foot traffic brings in more spontaneous visitors to a store without the need for much parking. However, people will continue to rely on cars if they don’t have convenient access to shops and restaurants on foot.</p>

<p>I spent a car-free 12 hours in the Bay Area going up and down the peninsula with the CalTrain. While the CalTrain is great, it’s spares train schedule (1 hour gaps during non-prime hours and 15-45 minutes gaps during prime hours) forces riders to plan their schedule around the trains, instead of just showing up at the station without planning and hopping onto a train.</p>

<p>This is more of the behavior you find with more mature transit systems, like in Chicago or New York. I never check when the next train is coming because trains come at a frequency of less than 10 minutes.</p>

<p>There’s definitely a lot to say about the state of public transit in the Bay Area, but I’ll conclude with a 1956 proposed public transit map of the Bay Area.</p>

<h2 id="tesla-insurance"><a href="https://www.tesla.com/support/insurance" target="_blank"><strong>Tesla Insurance</strong></a></h2>

<p><img src="https://kevinarifin.com/images/thought_bytes/tsla.png" alt="" class="img-responsive img-container-center" /></p>

<p>In a <a href="https://loupventures.com/tesla-model-3-cost-of-ownership-slightly-cheaper-than-a-camry/" target="_blank">Loup Ventures analysis</a> of the 5-year cost per mile of a Tesla, they found Tesla Model 3 ownership ($0.46 per mile) was <strong>cheaper</strong> than Toyota Camry ownership ($0.49 per mile).</p>

<p>Tesla announced <a href="https://www.tesla.com/support/insurance" target="_blank">Tesla Insurance</a> this week, which would offer car insurance with up to 30% lower rates. This further widens the price advantage for Tesla ownership, bringing the cost down to about $0.41 per mile.</p>

<p>This is yet another example of new players (Tesla) changing the game of an existing industry (car insurance). Tesla has created an integrated ecosystem that allows them to capture far more data about driver behavior and use that data to provide more granular insurance pricing.</p>

<p>While Stripe is in a completely orthogonal industry, their announcement of <a href="https://stripe.com/capital" target="_blank">Stripe Capital</a> is another new player (Stripe) changing the game of an existing industry (lending). Stripe has created an integrated ecosystem for small internet business payments, giving them access to a history of all the business transactions on Stripe to create the best loan terms for you.</p>

<p>Both Stripe and Tesla represent an industry trend of new integrated ecosystems giving access to more granular user data, easy sign-up for the services, and better value for an individual customer.</p>

<p>The most rewarding aspect of sending out a newsletter every week has been starting a dialogue about various topics with both friends and family, but also people I’ve never met.</p>

<p>While in the Bay Area, I met with one of my subscribers <a href="https://seekwell.substack.com/about?utm_source=menu-dropdown" target="_blank">Akshay</a>. We connected after he subscribed to my newsletter a couple months ago, but finally got a chance to meet in person during my California visit.</p>

<p>Akshay works at <a href="https://branch.io" target="_blank">Branch</a> as a data scientist. It was his first meet-up through the internet, and something we discussed was how underrated the internet was as a tool to meet new people with different perspective. Leveraging the internet as a broadcast medium not just through social media, but through personally curated newsletters, opens you up to content with an individual touch to it.</p>

<p>Akshay’s also looking to launch his newsletter <a href="https://seekwell.substack.com/about?utm_source=menu-dropdown" target="_blank">SeekWell</a>, where he’ll be writing about data science and becoming a compassionate human being.</p>

<p>I’ve been reading too many books about startups and self-improvement so I thought I’d mix it up a bit and read about dinosaurs. Dinosaurs were a huge childhood fascination of mine (definitely considered being a paleontologist at some point), so I decided to pick up a book on them.</p>

<p>From learning about the extreme climate when Earth’s continents still formed Pangaea to the Permian extinction, the book has been quite fascinating so far.</p>

<p>What’s craziest to me is how many of the time frames in the book like when dinosaurs first roamed the Earth are defined in millions of years. We operate in a world where each day so much happens, yet the highest granularity we can understand for the life of a dinosaur is in the millions of years.</p>
