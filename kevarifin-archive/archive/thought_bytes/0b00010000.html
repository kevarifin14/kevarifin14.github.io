                    <p>With my 16th newsletter, we’re moving to our 5th bit. Numbering my newsletters through bits reminds me of what metrics Grant Sanderson (or <a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCYO_jab_esuFRV4b17AJtAw" target="_blank">3Blue1Brown on Youtube</a>) likes to think about for his videos. If he has 1,000 views on his latest video, he’s not going for linear growth and 1,100 views on his next video: he wants to double the amount of views and hit 2,000.</p>

<p>While I’m somewhat constrained by time here, each new bit represents a doubling of my sent newsletters. Thank you for sticking with me through the first 5 bits, and hope to continue growing Thought Bytes as we approach 6th bit.</p>

<p>I’ve been going on a coffeeshop tour of Chicago on the weekends. Besides a creepy old man with a red umbrella outside, <a href="https://www.yelp.com/biz/ipsento-606-chicago" target="_blank">Ipsento 606</a> in Wicker Park was a pleasant place to work. Excellent lighting and ambiance, not too much foot traffic, and ample seating and outlets.</p>

<p>I don’t have a new post this week, but a lot of the news this week regarding WeWork’s S1 is related to what I wrote last week on <a href="https://kevinarifin.com/unbundle" target="_blank">The Unbundling of Business</a>. I detail some of my thoughts below and share my favorite takes on WeWork’s S1. Hope you’re enjoying the final weeks of summer and thank you for supporting Thought Bytes.</p>

<p><img src="https://kevinarifin.com/images/thought_bytes/twittercity.png" alt="" class="img-responsive img-container-center" /></p>

<p>Above is Laura Goodfellow’s first tweet of a 20-ish long <a href="https://twitter.com/transitrunner/status/1163272304266055681?s=21" target="_blank">tweet-storm</a> that I definitely recommend reading.</p>

<p>I’ve lived a car-free lifestyle in Chicago for over a year now. I walk, bike, or public transit everywhere and take the occasional Uber to parts that are harder to get to. You make choices around your chosen method of transportation. A car gives you car-based adventures: places that have ample parking (like lovely strip malls) or making one big grocery trip.</p>

<p>A walk-or-public-transit-based adventure is completely different. Impromptu stops at a coffeeshop that catches your eye or many small visits to the grocery store to grab things you need for dinner that night. Your lifestyle is different based on your chosen method of transportation. That’s why people can’t equate walking/biking/public transit as a direct replacement with a car, just as a person with a private jet can’t equate their jet as a replacement for a car.</p>

<p>Replacing the car with my two legs and the occasional train has definitely given me a different set of experiences than owning a car, but there’s nothing better than a walk home through the park after a long day of work (even when it’s freezing out). The best cities are defined at people-scale. I write about that <a href="https://kevinarifin.com/city" target="_blank">here</a>.</p>

<h2 id="a-little-more-on-wework">A Little More on WeWork</h2>

<p>Everyone has their take on the WeWork IPO. They’ve been mired in scandals, from the CEO licensing the “We Company” trademark for $5.9 million or the <a href="https://twitter.com/tristajaye/status/1162471350851817472" target="_blank">17th-ish employee didn’t get any equity</a>.</p>

<p>Scandals aside, the WeWork IPO brings attention to a truly interesting company. WeWork is trying to change real estate from a fixed cost to a variable cost, just as AWS did to servers 10+ years ago. This ties in well with the post I wrote last week: <a href="https://kevinarifin.com/unbundle" target="_blank">The Unbundling of Business</a>.</p>

<p>WeWork is the unbundling of real estate and office space from the business. Instead of a growing company having to forecast growth and rent an office of appropriate size, they can scale their office space with their company by adding desks and floors through WeWork as needed. In addition, they no longer need to be experts in renting office space or the local commercial real estate market. This goes back to the major theme of my essay:</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>People start businesses not to deal with legal overhead or building internal tools - they start companies to solve a unique problem they see with the world. The more they can focus their team’s attention on those problems, the more engaged everyone will be.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>WeWork is biting off the office space from the business. They’re taking on huge costs ($1.6 billion loss in 2018) and risks ($40 billion in future lease commitments) to do so, but their success is instrumental in empowering small companies to focus on their core capabilities.</p>

<p>Here are some of my favorite takes on the WeWork IPO.</p>

<ul>
  <li><a href="https://stratechery.com/2019/the-wework-ipo/" target="_blank">Ben Thompson on WeWork and how they are kind of analogous to AWS</a></li>

<p>I’m continuing my Nassim Taleb binge and reading his latest book in his <em>Incerto</em> series <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Skin-Game-Hidden-Asymmetries-Daily/dp/042528462X/ref=sr_1_1?keywords=skin+in+the+game&amp;qid=1566534158&amp;s=gateway&amp;sr=8-1" target="_blank"><em>Skin in the Game</em></a>. I’ve recently been interested in the asymmetric relationships in society and how many problems in today’s world are a result from misaligned incentives (think climate change or student debt crisis).</p>

<p>Taleb throws his usual shade at individuals who just talk and read books (politicians, economists) versus the individuals that actually have skin in the game. You learn by having something at stake: not only is it more exciting and you experience the thrills of the risk, but learning by doing is how you grow the most.</p>

<p>Excited to explore more of these ideas in depth, and I’m sure it will inspire some new posts.</p>
