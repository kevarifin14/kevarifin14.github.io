                    <p>Happy Saturday! Sorry the newsletter is two days late - Sarah and I got distracted playing one of my favorite games Civilization V together Friday evening. She and I talked about how the game is like product management (or starting a startup) - it’s all about weighing the opportunity costs of different tasks to achieve the most pressing goals.</p>

<p>As usual, I have my reflections this week from working on Edith. I’ve also been making more time to read so I’ve shared new reading notes and an update on what I’m currently reading. Hope you’ve been able to enjoy the small moments of shelter-in-place! See you next week ✌️</p>

<h2 id="startup-notes">Startup Notes</h2>

<p>As Edith matures as a product, more of my time has been fixing bugs or improving existing parts of the site based on user feedback. Pre-launch, the first two weeks of building Edith was rapid development of all the essential infrastructure to make an online platform work, from email notifications, deployment pipelines, and a flexible data model. This acted as a foundation to build additional features that users want, adapt to user feedback, and iterate into a product that both students and mentors value.</p>

<p><a href="https://twitter.com/Suhail/status/1261038970638528512" target="_blank">This tweet</a> by Suhail, former founder of Mixpanel and now working on Mighty, summarizes my thoughts pretty well.</p>

<p><img src="https://kevinarifin.com/images/thought_bytes/53/suhail.png" alt="" class="img-responsive img-container-center" /></p>

<p>Edith is transitioning from build to fix on the build -&gt; fix -&gt; sell spectrum. A lot of the features of the site have stabilized, we’ve seen some strong traction in terms of the changes we’ve made for the students, and eventually my work will go from improving and fixing to selling and scaling the site to support more students and mentors.</p>

<h2 id="reading-notes"><a href="https://kevinarifin.com/reading_notes/subtle-art-of-not-giving-a-f" target="_blank">Reading Notes</a></h2>

<p><img src="https://kevinarifin.com/images/books/subtle-art-of-not-giving-a-f.jpg" alt="" class="img-responsive img-container-center" /></p>

<p><em>The Subtle Art of Not Giving a F</em>ck* was a quick but valuable read. The book was full of common thoughts said in simple words and the contradictions in mindsets and achievement. I think the book boils down to two things (with accompanying quotes):</p>

<ol>
  <li>Think about what you’re willing to struggle for, not what you want.</li>
</ol>

<blockquote>
  <p>Who you are is defined by what you’re willing to struggle for. People who enjoy the struggles of a gym are the ones who run triathlons and have chiseled abs and can bench-press a small house. People who enjoy long workweeks and the politics of the corporate ladder are the ones who fly to the top of it. People who enjoy the stresses and uncertainties of the starving artist lifestyle are ultimately the ones who live it and make it.</p>
</blockquote>

<ol>
  <li>Be obsessed with improvement, not being great.</li>
</ol>

<blockquote>
  <p>The rare people who do become truly exceptional at something do so not because they believe they’re exceptional. On the contrary, they become amazing because they’re obsessed with improvement. And that obsession with improvement stems from an unerring belief that they are, in fact, not that great at all. It’s anti-entitlement. People who become great at something become great because they understand that they’re not already great—they are mediocre, they are average—and that they could be so much better.</p>
</blockquote>

<h2 id="what-im-reading">What I’m Reading</h2>

<p><img src="https://kevinarifin.com/images/books/technological-revolutions.jpg" alt="" class="img-responsive img-container-center" /></p>

<p>It’s easy to take for granted how much the technological revolution of mobile computing has changed what we view as normal. It’s now normal to call friends across the world, order dinner from your phone, and share photos and videos of every waking moment. But to get to this point, there had to be a changes not just in technology, but social, financial, and political paradigms as well.</p>

<p>Carlota Perez analyzes the relationship of advancement in technology and social/financial paradigms in her book <em>Technological Revolutions and Financial Capital</em>. She defines 5 main technological revolutions since the 18th century:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Industrial Revolution in the early 1800s</li>
  <li>The mid-19th century age of steam and railways</li>
  <li>Age of steel and electricity</li>
  <li>In the 1920s, age of the automobile and mass production</li>
  <li>1970s information age or knowledge society</li>
</ol>

<p>She develops a shared framework of irruption of growth, a frenzy of development, a synergy of tech and financial capital, and the eventual maturity of the technology. Written in 2002, the book has a lot of foresight of how the information age has played out, and I’m planning on writing a post using her framework to analyze the last 20 years of development. I highly recommend the book based on my reading so far if you’re interested in the intersection of tech and finance.</p>
