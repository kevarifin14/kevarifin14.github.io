                    <p>It’s been quite the week. We recently made a <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/feed/update/urn:li:activity:6655666409177255936/">public post about Edith Labs on LinkedIn</a> and it got over 2,000 responses - about two orders of magnitude more responses than I expected. It’s been really exciting to see the positive responses from both students and mentors interested in joining the platform.</p>

<p><img src="https://kevinarifin.com/images/thought_bytes/49/linkedinpost.png" alt="" class="img-responsive img-container-center" /></p>

<p>Please spread the word about Edith to anyone interested in joining as either a student or a mentor. If you’re interested in joining the platform in any capacity, happy to chat with you - <a href="https://calendly.com/kevinarifin/chat?month=2020-04" target="_blank">you can schedule time to talk here</a>.</p>

<p>On that note, I’m going to be focusing this week’s newsletter on some lessons from about a month and a half of working full time on my own startup. Also, if you read last week’s newsletter, I was working on a <a href="https://thousandapp.com" target="_blank">for-fun project to build an iPhone app</a> which I’ll talk a bit about as well!</p>

<p>Hope you’re staying healthy and see you next week!</p>

<h2 id="startup-notes">Startup Notes</h2>

<p><img src="https://kevinarifin.com/images/thought_bytes/49/new-landing-page.png" alt="" class="img-responsive img-container-center" /></p>

<p>Working on a startup has been a huge blessing and I’m grateful every day to get a chance to build something I’m passionate about. I reflected on some key takeaways from my first month and half working full-time on Edith Labs which I talk about below.</p>

<p><strong>If you think your idea is simple, it can probably be simpler</strong></p>

<p>Our goal at Edith is to allow people to invest in each other and share in their success. At first, our simplest idea of that was income share agreements to connect mentors and students. We had plans to start rolling out our MVP (minimal viable product) in June or July and start funding students in the Fall.</p>

<p>But really, the idea could be simpler. A conversation with one of my friends Andrew sparked an idea to make a platform for mentorship where students could make various asks and mentors could respond to these requests. So basically, ISAs and mentorship for students, without the ISAs.</p>

<p>After a two week grind, we launched this platform and currently have over 100 students and mentors, with over 2000 on the waitlist. Launching has allowed us to get immediate feedback from both students and mentors, observe the types of relationships being developed and the types of interactions, and assess the exact area of need that ISAs could fill.</p>

<p>And honestly, this idea could’ve been even simpler - there are a ton of “submit your email and we’ll match you with a mentor” services on LinkedIn that we could’ve done immediately without the two-week development time, which segues to my next point…</p>

<p><strong>Email is really powerful</strong></p>

<p>Email really is a powerful platform. My newsletter is built on email and it has given me a chance to stay in touch with a lot of friends as well as meet new ones I never would’ve connected with.</p>

<p>But email is a powerful and fast way to get off the ground, or accelerate growth on an existing platform. A lot of the mentorship and networking services that are springing up are built around email. They involve almost no code yet still allow a business to provide value through newsletters or introductions to mentors or interesting people.</p>

<p>Email notifications helped the Edith platform increase engagement without having to build a mobile app that sent mobile push notifications.</p>

<p>So if you’re having trouble making your idea even simpler, think about how just leveraging email as a tool could be your MVP. Still don’t believe me? Morning Brew has over 2 million subscribers to their email newsletter, and <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/morning-brew-to-more-than-quadruple-revenue-to-13-million-2019-11">it’s now valued at $13 million</a>.</p>

<p><strong>You’ll have to learn a lot of new skills</strong></p>

<p>Working on your own startup really forces you to both build depth and breadth. In the month and a half since I’ve gone full time, I’ve had to work on frontend and backend web development, learn how Docker works and plays well with AWS, work on marketing the product both on social media and through email marketing, and learn a little design to make a more professional landing page.</p>

<p>When it’s just a two-person operation, both things you’re good and not good at, you’re going to have to do. Figma (the design tool) was actually quite fun to use and it helped me make some graphics to make the first website I’m actually proud of design-wise. Here’s a snipped of a graphic I made with Figma and put on the new <a href="https://edithlabs.com" target="_blank">Edith Labs landing page</a>! Photo credits to my brother Andrew for the surrounding photos.</p>

<p>Necessity is the mother of invention and when you have to juggle multiple roles to build your business, you’re going to learn and develop skills that you never bothered to learn. It’s completely different than being at a bigger company, where it’s more important for you to be an expert in a specific area of the business.</p>

<h2 id="thousand"><a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/thousand-workout/id1507695611" target="_blank">Thousand</a></h2>

<p><img src="https://kevinarifin.com/images/thought_bytes/49/thousandapp.png" alt="" class="img-responsive img-container-center" /></p>

<p>Last week, I talked about <a href="https://kevinarifin.com/thought_bytes/0b00110000" target="_blank">code vs. no-code</a> and part of the experiment was building my own code-focused app.</p>

<p>I ended up publishing the app to the Apple App Store so if you’re interested in trying it out, you can download it <a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/thousand-workout/id1507695611" target="_blank">here</a> or visit the <a href="https://thousandapp.com" target="_blank">landing page</a> to learn more.</p>

<p>In case you forgot, the app is extremely simple. It allows you to track reps of 9 different bodyweight exercises. I’ve been using it to do the Thousand workout (1000 total reps of the 9 different exercises) to keep me active throughout the day.</p>

<p>Hope you give it a try and happy to hear any feedback!</p>
