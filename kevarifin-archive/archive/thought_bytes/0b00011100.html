                    <p>I’ve been thinking about new ways to structure my newsletter over the last couple weeks. It’s crazy to be sending newsletter #28 and I appreciate all the support and feedback about Thought Bytes.</p>

<p>The purpose of Thought Bytes has always been to share ideas that make you think, whether that be through my own content or podcast, articles, and videos I find online. To better achieve that goal, each week will feature a “Thought of the Week”: an idea I’ve been kicking around in my head that I want to share with you.</p>

<p>Of course, I’ll continue to share my favorite content from the week and my staple What I’m Reading section will always be there when I start reading new books. On to my Thought of the Week.</p>

<hr class="post-hr" />

<h2 id="thought-of-the-week">Thought of the Week</h2>

<p>I spent the last week reading <em>The Headspace Guide to Meditation and Mindfulness</em>, and one of Andy Puddicombe’s anecdotes from the introduction stuck with me.</p>

<p>Andy discusses his experience in clown school, where every day they were asked to do things outside of their comfort zone. On a daily basis, they would get called on stage, instructed to do random things on stage and if they didn’t react quickly enough, the teacher would bang a drum to send them off stage.</p>

<p>It got me thinking - how often do I do things outside of my comfort zone? The most uncomfortable I am on a daily basis might be my workout for the day, and I don’t always push myself hard enough to get out of my physical and mental comfort zone.</p>

<p>This thought is related to another idea I’ve been kicking around this week as well - thinking about everything as a muscle. If you don’t exercise a particular ability, you’ll lose it.</p>

<p>Doing things outside of your comfort zone is a muscle - if you don’t train yourself to get out of your comfort zone, it gets harder and harder to step out of your comfort zone. By extension, not stepping out of your comfort zone means your not growing.</p>

<p>Writing online, cold messaging individuals on Twitter, and sending a weekly newsletter have been steps out of my comfort zone this year.</p>

<p>Steps outside of your comfort zone is not just about doing more - it’s doing things differently or cutting things out. I’ve changed my sleep schedule so I wake up and sleep at the same time (much more efficient and I’ve felt more well-rested). I’ve also cut out most of my alcohol consumption (freeing up evenings and mornings, and also helped me sleep more consistently).</p>

<p>The challenge in my mind is how do I put myself in a situation where I’m out of my comfort zone every day? It’s easy to get in the routine of work or school and just be comfortable - it’s the path of least resistance. I would love to hear your thoughts on how you step out of your comfort zone.</p>

<p>Bill Gates has been a popular topic on Twitter over the last week after <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_15DReQKbt8" target="_blank">his interview at the New York Times DealBook conference</a>. I took some time to watch the full interview. Here are my thoughts on some key points in the interview.</p>

<p><strong>The Wealth Tax</strong></p>

<p>Individuals that take asymmetric risk to form billion dollar companies deserve to capture a slice of that value they created. But hopefully these individuals use this wealth for not just personal consumption but philanthropic endeavors.</p>

<p>Everyone is reaping the benefits of Bill Gates and Microsoft catalyzing the PC revolution, and he arguably earned his fortune. He continues to be a positive impact on the world as his Gates Foundation solves problems not even sovereign governments can solve.</p>

<p>Gates views philanthropy as the 2% of the economy that solves problems that the private sector and government can’t or won’t solve.</p>

<p><strong>Technology Today</strong></p>

<p>It was interesting to get Gates’s opinion on the Microsoft lawsuit in the early 2000s. He claims that without the lawsuit, Microsoft would’ve won mobile. The lawsuit definitely hurt Microsoft but he feels like it didn’t make the industry more competitive.</p>

<p>I personally think that Microsoft wouldn’t have one mobile as many of their later efforts indicated an ability to translate their success making the operating system for computers to phones. They were also already falling behind as internet companies made the web browser the new operating system of the computer.</p>

<p><strong>Jeff Bezos and Space</strong></p>

<p>I love his quote on Elon Musk and Jeff Bezos and their fascination with space: “I read a lot of science fiction but I guess not as much as they did.”</p>

<p>Gates has pretty noble philanthropic goals of solving tough problems on Earth that don’t receive a lot of attention. He has an inspiring perspective on the type of legacy he wants to leave: “I want to work on things that in a sense, people will forget. I want you to forget there was ever polio or malaria.”</p>

<p><strong>His Friendship with Buffet</strong></p>

<p>He originally didn’t want to meet Warren Buffet because he viewed buying and selling things on the market and finding inefficiencies to be playing a zero-sum game that is almost parasitic.</p>

<p>But upon meeting him, he realized Buffet is not that different from him: judging markets and people in order to develop a model for how the world works.</p>

<p>Sarah and I are continuing to read more books in the Enderverse. We just started <em>Shadow of the Hegemon</em>, one branch of sequels for Orson Scott Card’s iconic book <em>Ender’s Game</em>.</p>

<p>This branch of sequels follows Bean, one of the supporting characters in <em>Ender’s Game</em>. The details what happens to Earth after a world united in beating an alien species defeats the enemy and no longer has a common reason to cooperate. If you’re looking for a new science fiction series to dive into, I recommend joining us as we read through the Enderverse.</p>
