                    <p>Happy debate night to everyone following the 2020 Presidential Election race. I’m wrapping up this week’s newsletter while watching the debate.</p>

<p>I’ll be traveling a lot for the rest of the month going from Chicago to New York to San Francisco and finally back to Chicago. It’s made me think a lot about the trade-off between having a steady routine and constantly being in new environments.</p>

<p>When I spend extended periods of time in Chicago, I develop good habits of working out daily, eating healthy, and sleeping and waking up at the same time. I find it makes me efficient and productive. Traveling exposes me to new environments, people, and places to work, which definitely helps spark creativity.</p>

<p>There’s a lot in this week’s newsletter. I share my thoughts on Apple and this week’s iPhone announcement, a cool chart about the growth of computer science at Berkeley, and a few of my favorite internet content from the past week. See you next week ✌️</p>

<h2 id="the-future-of-apple"><a href="https://kevinarifin.com/future-of-apple" target="_blank">The Future of Apple</a></h2>

<p><img src="https://kevinarifin.com/images/apple.jpg" alt="" class="img-responsive img-container-center" /></p>

<p>I usually don’t write posts about a specific company, but my recap about Apple turned much longer than I intended so I turned it into a <a href="https://kevinarifin.com/future-of-apple" target="_blank">short post</a>.</p>

<p>The expectation at each of these Apple keynotes is innovation. Apple even says so with their tagline “By Innovation Only”. While I am a huge Apple fan and I own nearly all their products, Apple’s era of innovation is long gone.</p>

<p>Apple’s transition to services indicates their transition to focusing on sustaining their business model. If you expect the Apple events to be like Steve Jobs innovative unveiling of the first iPhone, you will be disappointed. Not to say Apple isn’t a great company with a superior technology ecosystem. But when glasses, contact lenses, brain machine interfaces, or another crazy way of connecting to the internet becomes reality, Apple’s ecosystem will no longer matter.</p>

<p><a href="https://kevinarifin.com/future-of-apple" target="_blank"><strong>Read my full post here.</strong></a></p>

<p>On a side note, I succumbed and bought the Series 5 Apple Watch, one of the few Apple products I don’t own. A big reason for buying one was to compete with friends and family in the Activity tracking on the Apple Watch, which speaks to the strong external network effect Apple has created with the Apple Watch. It also allows me to track more granular data about my health from resting heart rate and heart rate variability to calories burned during workouts, and as you probably already know, I love the insights data can provide on my health habits. Add me on the Activity App!</p>

<p>The number of Berkeley Computer Science majors has gone from 200 to 2000, a nearly 10x increase. I still remember taking the introductory CS course at Berkeley (CS61A) with around 1,000 people in the class and seeing that number almost double by the time I graduated in 2018. Why find the 10x engineer when you have 10x more engineers?</p>

<p>An interesting <a href="https://www.citylab.com/transportation/2019/08/commute-time-city-size-transportation-urban-planning-history/597055/" target="_blank">article from City Lab</a> analyzed the shape of cities and its relationship to commutes. The size of cities grows based on the fastest mode of transportation for a 30 min commute to work.</p>

<p>In ancient times, the fastest way to get around was on foot. Most cities pre-Industrial Revolution did not grow much bigger than a two-mile diameter. Rome had over a million people within a two-mile diameter and Beijing’s walls enclosed an inner city 3 miles in diameter.</p>

<p>The invention of the bikes and streetcars led to cities growing to 8 miles in diameter or about 50 square miles. Chicago is an example of an early streetcar city in 1915.</p>

<p>The culmination of this evolution is the car city. Atlanta and Houston are examples of car cities, which stretch to cover over 1250 square miles, but the 30 minute rule still holds. The average one-way commute in American metropolitan areas is 26 minutes.</p>

<p>Weaning America off of the car city involves improving alternative methods to commuting 30 minutes to work. That requires zoning for mixed-use density, building out public transit, and increasing the convenience of bikes and electric scooters. It’ll be interesting to see the evolution of the city as new technologies arise like hyperloop and self-driving cars.</p>
