                    <p>Greetings from San Francisco! This is stop two of my travels during the latter part of September. I spent the earlier part of the week in New York, and I must admit I definitely missed the New York City vibe. Something about the city just feels different, and I see why it attracts young, ambitious people.</p>

<p>I lived in New York from September 2018 to February 2019, and I spent much of my 4-day visit going to all my favorite places. I ate at my favorite NY restaurant Raku, went to a show at Comedy Cellar, and worked at a cozy coffeeshop called Irving Farm. I even got a haircut at On the Mark, my go-to place in NY.</p>

<p>This reminds me of my previous thoughts on the difference between travel and living someplace. Travel is like a buffet - you want to capture as much value in a short period of time, so you don’t take any risks of going to a dud place and trust reviews and recommendations from friends. Living someplace is more like the natural cadence of your daily meals - some boring and uneventful, others not so tasty, and the occasional discovery of a new favorite place.</p>

<p>When I travel, the goal is usually to get a feel for what it’s like to live there, and I think it requires bridging the gap between buffet and a normal meal. Normal life is full of work and routine, but also room to take risks outside of the reviewed and recommended.</p>

<p>Moving on to the newsletter, I highlight the amazing introduction of <em>Factfulness</em> (with a short quiz), and also share two somewhat related articles about time and productivity. I also share my Twitter thread on California’s controversial AB 5 bill. Hope you have a great last week of summer ✌️</p>

<p>I usually don’t start my newsletters with what I’m reading, but this short quiz from the introduction of <em>Factfulness</em> was quite impactful and challenged my world-view. As a hint, the subtitle of the book is <em>Ten Reasons We’re Wrong About the World – and Why Things Are Better Than You Think</em>. Don’t be worried about your score - I personally scored 3/13 (which apparently is the average score).</p>

<p>The correct answers are at the bottom of the newsletter. Meanwhile, some spoilers and observations from the book.</p>

<p>I knew the premise of the book was yet still underestimated the improvements the world has made over the last couple decades. I personally fell victim to several of the reasons why Rosling thinks we underestimate global progress: an expectation of bad news and a static view on countries and their respective cultures.</p>

<p>The introduction quiz sets the foundation for the misconceptions people have, no matter where they live or what level of education they are (in fact, so called “experts” performed worse on some questions). <em>Factfulness</em> explores the reasons why our perception of the world doesn’t always match the facts of reality. It’s a quick read, yet essential to understand because we can’t be making decisions for today with a mindset of the what the world was like in 1965.</p>

<h2 id="in-praise-of-being-unproductive"><a href="https://hbr.org/2019/09/in-praise-of-being-unproductive" target="_blank"><strong>In Praise of Being Unproductive</strong></a></h2>

<p>I constantly feel the need to be doing something. If I’m not working, reading a book, or listening to a podcast on a walk, I’m scrolling through Twitter or going through unread emails. Rarely is my brain doing nothing, and when it is, it feels the pressure to do something and starts thinking about the next thing on the calendar.</p>

<p><a href="https://hbr.org/2019/09/in-praise-of-being-unproductive" target="_blank">JM Olejarz’s article <em>In Praise of Being Unproductive</em></a> discusses the consequences of our constant connectedness with our devices. Being constantly connected means we can always be “productive”, but we lose sight of what actually matters to us.</p>

<p>He highlights Tiffany Shlain’s idea of a “tech Shabbat”: a day a week without screens or devices. My immediate reaction was questions of how a day without my phone would work.</p>

<p>How would I coordinate meeting up with a friend? How would I find a cool coffeeshop recommended by a random Redditor? I guess I wouldn’t have anything to do in the coffeeshop because I spend most of the time on my computer so I’d have to get a physical book to read, or a physical notebook to write on. But most importantly, imagining a day without devices made me realize how much my day-to-day life revolved around them.</p>

<p>It’s always funny when you put your phone down and just observe everyone else, head down scrolling through their app of choice. We’re constantly pushed and nudged in the direction the phone wants us to go. A tech Shabbat and an acceptance of being unproductive might just be the things we need to do to regain our own sense of direction.</p>

<p>Some of my favorite lines from the article:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>“When our identities depend solely on what we contribute to a company’s P&amp;L statement, we’re likely to end up losing who we really are.”</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>“Pulling back from what’s efficient and profitable lets us focus on what’s actually worthwhile.”</p>

<h2 id="time-is-weird"><a href="https://qz.com/1516804/physics-explains-why-time-passes-faster-as-you-age/amp/?__twitter_impression=true" target="_blank"><strong>Time is Weird</strong></a></h2>

<p>What goes hand-in-hand with being productive? Time. I always feel like I’m running out, and even worse, I feel like time is going by faster as I grow older. This seems to be the general sentiment as well among my friends.</p>

<p>When I was younger, I observed that the first hour so after waking up passed by in a blur. I would use the bathroom, take out my contacts (I wore the overnight CRT contacts), and wash my face and a few minutes was actually fifteen minutes flying by.</p>

<p>This observation is actually the basis of <a href="https://qz.com/1516804/physics-explains-why-time-passes-faster-as-you-age/amp/?__twitter_impression=true" target="_blank">research done by Adrian Bejan</a>, who describes the difference between “clock time” and “mind time”.</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Clock time:</strong> The measurable passage of the 24-hour day-night period on all watches</li>
  <li><strong>Mind time:</strong> The time that you perceive</li>
</ul>

<p>These two times are not equivalent. Clock time passes the same for everyone. But mind time actually does change as you get older. Bejan attributes this to saccadic eye movements, jerk-like eye movements that process visual information. The more information you are processing, the slower the passage of mind time.</p>

<a href="https://qz.com/1516804/physics-explains-why-time-passes-faster-as-you-age/amp/?__twitter_impression=true" target="_blank">Source: Quartz</a></p>

<p>My theory about my passage of morning time is that when I wake up, I’m processing less information so clock time goes by faster than mind time. As I wake up, I process more information and the passage of mind time starts to slow down.</p>

<p>The cadence of saccades is also related to our fatigue level. A tired individual processes information less efficiently, and thus according to Bejan’s theory, passes mind time more quickly.</p>

<p>So to make more mind time for yourself, you have to spend more clock time resting.</p>

<h2 id="ab-5"><a href="https://twitter.com/kevarifin/status/1173718394027302912" target="_blank"><strong>AB 5</strong></a></h2>

<p>I tweeted a (much longer than intended) <a href="https://twitter.com/kevarifin/status/1173718394027302912" target="_blank">thread</a> this week detailing my position on California’s AB 5 bill:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Contrary to popular opinion, Uber should be for AB 5 and drivers should be against it. For those unfamiliar with AB 5, it’s a California bill that was recently voted through requiring ride-share companies to classify drivers as employees and not contractors. This has consequences of Uber, Lyft, and other gig-style companies having to provide things like unemployment insurance and health benefits.</p>

  <p>Drivers and much of the general public are for AB 5 because they believe big companies like Uber and Lyft are exploiting contracted drivers. Uber and Lyft are against AB 5 because it would greatly increase the marginal cost of contracting/employing a driver. However, I believe these positions are misplaced and should actually be flipped. Hear me out.</p>

  <p>Uber in particular should be for AB 5. They have only 6% revenue exposure to California whereas Lyft has 20% (courtesy of <a href="https://twitter.com/stratechery" target="_blank">@stratechery</a>). AB 5 would give Uber a reason to restrict drivers that are now employees to only drive for Lyft. Given Uber’s general lead in ride-sharing (from my experience most drivers are Uber-first and use Lyft to fill in the gaps), drivers will likely stick with Uber, pushing Lyft out of the market. This in the long-term has always been a necessity for Uber to be profitable.</p>

  <p>Drivers on the other hand, should not want AB 5 to be passed. A market with a single player (Uber) would give them zero leverage. Many of the perks and bonuses Uber and Lyft provide are a result of each respective company trying to attract more drivers. The situation might even improve with more competitors in the marketplace.</p>

  <p>AB 5 would make it basically impossible for a new ride sharing company to enter the market. Uber and Lyft could scale because venture money paid for a critical mass of drivers to make ride sharing possible. With AB 5, the upfront cost of starting a ride sharing company would be prohibitively high, leaving drivers with only a single market participant, most likely Uber, with no competition to keep the driver around.</p>

  <p><strong>The way to improve driver compensation and benefits would be to introduce more competition for drivers in the marketplace. That means reducing the barrier for entry to starting a ride sharing company, not increasing it.</strong></p>
</blockquote>

<p>I would love to hear your thoughts on the bill. It’s a pretty important piece of legislation and could affect the landscape of gig-economy startups for years to come.</p>
