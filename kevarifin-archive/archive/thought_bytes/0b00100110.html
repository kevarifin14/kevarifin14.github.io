                    <p>Happy Thursday! This coming week I’m going to Davenport, Iowa, of all places. I’ll be volunteering for <a href="https://www.yang2020.com" target="_blank">Andrew Yang’s presidential campaign</a> and knocking on doors to tell people about Andrew Yang.</p>

<p>As someone born in the Bay Area, I knew little about Davenport, the 90th largest combined statistical area (a mixture of metropolitan and rural areas), so I spent some time learning about the region. Some fun facts from my research:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Davenport is part of the Quad Cities, which is actually a group of 5 cities but the name Quint Cities never caught on.</li>
  <li>The demographics are about 90% white, 3.7% black, 1% Asian, so I will definitely be in the minority.</li>
  <li>I did a little research on <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/QuadCities/comments/98w3jo/moving_to_davenport_from_missouri/" target="_blank">Reddit</a> to see if the city was dangerous. Here are some somewhat reassuring testimonials about the city.
    <ul>
      <li>“You will be at high risk of dying from boredom.”</li>
      <li>“Anyway, then I got really paranoid myself about it. The boredom is now my biggest fear!”</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>Nevertheless, I’m excited for my trip to Iowa. As I’ve written before, it’s easy to get stuck in our physical and digital networks and never interact with people, ideas, and perspectives outside that network.</p>

<p>Even if I were to take a leisurely trip to Iowa, I wouldn’t have the opportunity to interact with the people in the community, so this is a unique opportunity to get that new perspective.</p>

<p>This week’s newsletter features one of my favorite articles I’ve read discussing a framework of viewing your life in terms of network effects. It’s quite lengthy, but it’s worth the read and I provide my own thoughts on the article as well. See you next week ✌️</p>

<h2 id="thought-bit-network-effects">Thought Bit: Network Effects</h2>

<p><img src="https://kevinarifin.com/images/thought_bytes/38/nfx.jpg" alt="" class="img-responsive img-container-center" /></p>

<p>This <a href="https://www.nfx.com/post/your-life-network-effects?utm_source=twitter&amp;utm_medium=social&amp;utm_campaign=internalshare-james" target="_blank">excellent article</a> by James Currier of the VC firm NFX discusses a framework for viewing how network effects drive your life.</p>

<p>Each of us is a node in the network, and we are constantly exchanging ideas, connections, and aspirations among other things. There are a couple interesting consequences of viewing people as a network:</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Zipf’s Law</strong>: frequency is inversely proportional to rank. Examples of this frequency of words in a language and populations of cities in a country. For example, New York (rank 1 population in the US) is about twice as large as LA (rank 2), and about three times larger than Chicago (rank 3). Here are some interesting consequences:
    <ol>
      <li>This means that as New York grows by 100 people, LA grows by 50, and Chicago grows by 33, all the way down the line.</li>
      <li>Your decision to live in a certain city or work a certain job will unconsciously impact the lives and careers of other people in the network.</li>
    </ol>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>Why is this important? Let’s apply this idea to people networks: rich nodes/networks get richer, faster, than other nodes/networks. We see this happening with the start up and venture capital scenes, with the San Francisco Bay Area clearly in the lead but New York on the rise and many auxiliary cities like Austin and Seattle on their way as well.</p>

<p>So why do the network effect of our life follow Zipf’s Law? This is a great excerpt from the article explaining why:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The nodes exchange more of these things when the friction is low due to physical proximity, interaction frequency, tribal trust, similarity, etc. The nodes also exchange more when the benefit is high due to resources gain, status gain, tribal trust gain, etc.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>This idea of network effects is a framework for decision making. When I talk with college students about their career interests, they tend to focus on how much money they will be making, promotions within the company, or what projects they could be working on.</p>

<p>Thinking about it in the context of network effects, they are asking the wrong questions. Let’s use a slightly different example of an aspiring software engineer choosing between UC Berkeley and Harvard, both prestigious schools with Harvard holding a clear edge in ranking.</p>

<p>Within the context of network effects, a student with aspirations to be an engineer should attend Berkeley, which has a strong network of students interested in software engineers, alumni software engineers working in the area, and proximity to the most prestigious tech companies and startups.</p>

<p>I found Currier’s analytical approach to network effects to be a valuable decision making framework. However, I disagree with completely following the network that aligns with your aspirations.</p>

<p>As someone plugged into the Bay Area network my whole life, stepping out of the software engineering and tech network gave the needed perspective to approach problems in a different light. While there’s definitely opportunity cost stepping out of the network of least effort, the cross-pollination of ideas is where I believe innovation is born from.</p>

<h2 id="new-york-circa-1900">New York circa 1900</h2>

<a href="https://twitter.com/citnaj/status/1219156481762713602?s=12" target="_blank">Source: Twitter</a></p>

<p>Whenever I imagine a scene from the 1900s, it’s black and white in my mind. If it’s something from the 70s, it’s grainy like a 70s film.</p>

<p>This colorized photo of New York in the 1900s was created by <a href="https://twitter.com/citnaj" target="_blank">Jason Antic</a> using his DeOldify deep learning model. This image definitely shook my imagination of what the 1900s were like.</p>

<p>Here is the original image for reference.</p>
