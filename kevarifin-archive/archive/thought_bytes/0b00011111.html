                    <p>Back to our regularly scheduled programming. Hope you had a good Thanksgiving holiday - holidays and time off from work are always good reminders to take a moment to enjoy life and spend time with friends and family.</p>

<p>I went to my second Andrew Yang rally in Chicago today. He overflowed a 3,000 seat auditorium at University of Illinois, Chicago, way more than the few hundred people at his rally in April.</p>

<p><img src="https://kevinarifin.com/images/thought_bytes/yangchi.jpg" alt="" class="img-responsive img-container-center" /></p>

<p>Sadly, I didn’t get a picture with him this time, but it’s way more important to see how much his support has grown. For more of my thoughts on Andrew Yang, here’s my <a href="https://kevinarifin.com/why-im-voting-for-andrew-yang" target="_blank">post</a> I wrote back in April.</p>

<p>On to the newsletter.</p>

<h2 id="thought-byte-the-unexpected-lessons-of-scrapbooking">Thought Byte: The Unexpected Lessons of Scrapbooking</h2>

<p>I spent a lot of Thanksgiving week putting together a physical scrapbook of the last year with Sarah. We printed out photos, kept a lot of physical artifacts from our travels, and laid out and put together the pages. We probably spent upwards of 10 hours (we had over 100+ photos and ended up being over 50 pages), but it was well worth the time. On further reflection, scrapbooking is related to many of things I’ve thought about and read this year.</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Information abundance</strong>:</p>

    <p>It’s easy to take a lot of photos now. So easy that we often take photos for granted. Rarely do I look back at my phones camera roll or create albums for special events. Just as curating what you consume online is important, curating the photos you’ve taken becomes more important when you can take a lot of them.</p>

    <p>Downsampling our photos from the past year forced us to pick out what mattered to us the most. What are the key moments I want to remember from the year? What photos would trigger the best memories years down the line? It’s hard to look through thousands of photos from the past couple of years, but perusing through a select few helps you find the signal from all the noise.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Do things that compound</strong>:</p>

    <p>When I do go through old photos, rarely do I ever regret taking a photo of a moment. More often than not, I regret not taking a photo in a particular moment I wish I captured. Taking a moment out of the moment to snap a photo is one part of the investment.</p>

    <p>Putting them together into an easily accessible format is the second part of the investment. It may have cost hours of my time this past week, but as memories fade, it’s an artifact I can continue sharing with my family.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>While I’m not recommending everyone out there to start scrapbooking, it’s important to take the time to appreciate the things that make life worth living: time spent with friends and family. Whether that’s making a video of a trip, doing a daily journal, or making a scrapbook, taking the time to downsample the noise of photos, videos, thoughts, and memories will definitely pay dividends in time.</p>

<h2 id="taking-risks">Taking Risks</h2>

<p>I discovered an interesting <a href="https://80000hours.org/2019/11/anonymous-answers-risk-aversion/" target="_blank">article</a> on <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/EffectiveAltruism/" target="_blank">r/EffectiveAltruism</a> this past week with a collection of interesting takes on risk taking.</p>

<p>Some of the key ideas:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Risk taking and financial stability go hand in hand</strong>. Risk aversion is a result of scarcity in your personal resources. The world misses out on some really talented people because they feel like they can’t take the risk.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Things that are risky are unappealing.</strong> Given the choice of guaranteed money and job security or something with a 1 in 20 chance of succeeding wildly, most people are going to lean the former. That’s why we need to subsidize risk-taking as much as possible as a society.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>There are hidden risks to taking risks.</strong> If you’re going to make a bet on yourself, some of the things that don’t appear to be risks - spending excessive time on social media, going out, and wasting time - are what add up the most and can be costly to your success.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>For those that want to take risks, there are a lot of backup plans</strong>. Before taking a risk, those in a strong financial position can save up to 6 months worth of expenses. Grad school is a good opportunity to restart if an endeavor fails. If you can get help from family, have a strong academic background, or have relevant industry skills, there is nothing to be afraid of.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<h2 id="software-is-complicated">Software Is Complicated</h2>

<p>It’s easy to take well-designed software for granted. Call an Uber? It arrives in a few minutes. Send a text message? It arrives on your friends phone no problem. But behind every feature is complicated logic that some engineers probably debated over and implemented. Here’s a diagram of the workflow Slack goes through to figure out whether or not it should send you a notification:</p>

<p>Sarah and I are zooming through the Enderverse books. We’re almost done with the second book of the Shadow sequence of the series, <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Shadow-Puppets-Ender-Orson-MassMarket/dp/B00C7EVBIC/ref=sr_1_3?crid=6WYZNLM2TQD9&amp;keywords=shadow+puppets+orson+scott+card&amp;qid=1575605258&amp;sprefix=shadow+puppets+orson+%2Caps%2C153&amp;sr=8-3" target="_blank"><em>Shadow Puppets</em></a>. I don’t want to spoil too much of the series, but if you’re into war games and global politics with a mix of science fiction, this is quite the page turner.</p>
