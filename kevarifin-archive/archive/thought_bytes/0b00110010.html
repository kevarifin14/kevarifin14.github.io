                    <p>Happy Friday! With shelter-in-place in place for another month, I thought a bit about the end game of social distancing and coronavirus. With trials of Gilead’s COVID-19 treatment flopping, a cure is most likely months to a year out at least. What, if anything, will lead to a lifting of social distancing policies? And even if these changes are made, everyone is going to be paranoid of people coughing and sneezing around them.</p>

<p>Naval shared an interesting take on COVID-19 recently. <a href="https://twitter.com/naval/status/1250862893605634048" target="_blank">(Read the whole thread for more context)</a></p>

<p><img src="https://kevinarifin.com/images/thought_bytes/50/naval-covid.png" alt="" class="img-responsive img-container-center" /></p>

<p>It seems like an interesting policy that could be implemented would be allowing young individuals to move normally if they don’t come into contact with anyone 45 or older (like if you live with your parents). Allow young people (less likely to be hospitalized and die) to develop immunity, and by extension help build herd immunity, while high risk individuals or people that come into regular contact with high risk individuals shelter-in-place.</p>

<p>This policy would definitely be harder to enforce compared to an everyone shelter-in-place, but would help get society to herd immunity while still somewhat alleviating hospital capacity. Anyways, just some non-expert thoughts on COVID-19.</p>

<p>On to the newsletter.</p>

<h2 id="startup-notes">Startup Notes</h2>

<p>I was talking with Nick this week about how interesting it would be to have started writing a newsletter in college. Having 4 years of weekly notes, basically an inside look of being a Berkeley EECS student, would have been cool to have in hindsight.</p>

<p>In the same vein, as I go on the journey of working on my own startup, I think it would be prudent of me to write some notes of things I learn, just as I did with last week’s newsletter.</p>

<p>This week’s big lessons revolved around driving engagement on the Edith platform. Two key ideas:</p>

<p><strong>Personal emails are an effective way of driving engagement.</strong></p>

<p>We spent some time this week doing some manual work of matching students with mentors. We sent personal emails to students that hadn’t asked a question yet on the platform suggesting they reach out to the mentor.</p>

<p>The personalized messages got a lot of responses and led to a lot more asks being made on the platform. From what we’ve observed on the platform, students that make an ask (prompted by us or not), tend to be retained users that continue to engage with different mentors. This made the task of doing some manual matching worth, as once they engage, they generally stay engaged.</p>

<p>While this is clearly not scalable, its definitely worth it in the beginning to get the platform off the ground and see what works or not in terms of mentor and student interactions. Which leads me to my next point…</p>

<p><strong>Users like being told what to do.</strong></p>

<p>Whatever platform, productivity tool, or social network you’re using, you subconsciously try to make as few decisions as possible. It’s no wonder that the vast majority of users on social networks like Twitter and Reddit are lurkers. Even with documentation for code libraries or how-to articles for Figma, the easiest ones to follow are the ones that tell you exactly what to click and type.</p>

<p>On Edith, we know students have questions and want to have discussions with a mentor, but not all are engaging with a mentor. Part of lowering that barrier to engaging with a mentor was doing the manual work to match students with a mentor. The next hurdle is helping students figure out what to ask. Even personally, I’ve often knew I wanted to know something, but couldn’t exactly describe what I wanted to know.</p>

<p>Overall, we’ve had over 100+ requests for help on Edith and we’re continuing to onboard more students and mentors. Continuing to drive engagement and understand how to best help the students will be an open question and only constantly iterating will lead us to the right combination of factors that work.</p>

<h2 id="reading-notes-kochland"><a href="https://kevinarifin.com/reading_notes/kochland" target="_blank">Reading Notes: Kochland</a></h2>

<p><img src="https://kevinarifin.com/images/books/kochland.jpg" alt="" class="img-responsive img-container-center" /></p>

<p>I finally made some time to work on my reading notes for <em>Kochland</em>. One of the most interesting excerpts from the book, which I think capture the scale, complexity, and diversity of the operations at Koch Industries:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The mechanics of the contango storage play seem deceptively simple. A trader at Koch Industries buys oil in the spot markets, where it is cheap. Then, the trader sells oil for delivery in the futures markets, where oil is more expensive. When the contango gap is $8, it is easy to picture how quickly the profits pile up. The trader can buy oil for $35 and sell it for $43, almost instantly. There is a catch, however. To execute the contango storage play, the trader must be able to do something that most traders can’t do—they must be able to deliver the actual, physical oil in that future month. If a typical oil speculator—who did not own an oil refinery, storage tanks, or an oil tanker ship—tried to execute the contango storage trade, they could find themselves shut out. Executing the contango storage trade didn’t just require deep knowledge of arcane shipping markets and transportation law; it also required deep relationships in the private world of oil production. “You have to have a lot of support systems to take advantage of it,” Beckett said. Koch had that support system. Koch could deliver the oil.</p>

<h2 id="what-im-reading">What I’m Reading</h2>

<p><img src="https://kevinarifin.com/images/books/nudge.jpg" alt="" class="img-responsive img-container-center" /></p>

<p>I’ve been slacking a bit on my reading, but I’ve started my next book <em>Nudge</em> on Nick’s recommendation. <em>Nudge</em> is about how the decisions we make on a day-to-day basis are not always rational and influenced by small, sometimes unseen, influences in our environment.</p>

<p>The book defines the term choice architect, or someone who has the ability to influence the decisions of others. An example of a choice architect is a UI/UX designer who made the Facebook Messenger app. Different design decisions compel you to respond to message (notification badges) or find a person to message (active or not indicators).</p>

<p>So far, I’ve found the book interesting (though it reads like a research paper), especially as I’m a choice architect as I build Edith interfaces for students and mentors. We’ll see what insights come from the book as I continue to improve the platform.</p>
