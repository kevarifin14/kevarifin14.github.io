                    <p>Happy Thursday! Time goes by quite fast since I feel like I just wrote a newsletter about reaching the 5th bit, and now we have reached bit 6, meaning 16 weeks have gone by.</p>

<p>This week was particularly exciting since Andrew Yang just qualified for next Thursday’s debate. He’s now one of seven candidates on the stage, and now has over 350,000 unique donors, polling in the top 5, and probably raising over $20 million in Q4. I’m continually impressed not just with his policies, but the way he runs his campaign like a startup.</p>

<p>My friend Wayne told me an interesting fact that since 1972 the Democratic nominee has always been polling between 2-10% in December, so if you think he’s a long shot, history tells us that he has a chance.</p>

<p>On to the newsletter.</p>

<h2 id="thought-of-the-week-hacking-tests">Thought of the Week: Hacking Tests</h2>

<p>This week’s thoughts focus on my reflections on Paul Graham’s <a href="http://paulgraham.com/lesson.html" target="_blank">latest essay</a> on the hackability of testing from high school through college, including the college admissions process. Good test scores lead to good grades, and everyone judges you on your grades. If tests and learning were conflated this wouldn’t be a problem, but in reality, you’re making a choice between learning and doing well on the exam. Tests found in school are often hackable to the point that the tests no longer measure what they’re supposed to measure: how much you’ve learned.</p>

<p><strong>20 years of education trains you to be good at hacking bad tests.</strong></p>

<p>I was a categorically good student throughout my 20 years of schooling. I struggled during the first round of college midterms, and from my recollection, my learning/studying process involved going to class, reading the textbook and related course materials, and diligently working through the problems sets and labs.</p>

<p>That, I found, didn’t translate to success on the exams. What did translate to success on the test was not going to lecture, not reading the textbook, and not doing the lab. Instead, just do as many exam-like problems as possible and learn from those mistakes. This realization carried me through the rest of college.</p>

<p>As an undergraduate student instructor for a computer science class, this was also advice I gave to students when they asked how to prepare for exams. My advice to my students was more akin to a machine learning algorithm than actual learning. Find as many practice exams as you can, take an exam, score yourself and mark everything you got wrong. Then figure out why you got the problem wrong and write down how to do it correctly. Take another exam and repeat. Once you take all the exams, take them again, and make sure you didn’t miss the same questions.</p>

<p>I often get asked if I like college life or work life better. While I do miss the community and density of like-minded students at Berkeley, post-college life has given me the freedom to choose what I want to learn and develop my own framework of evaluating my learning. There are no graduation requirements or exams - there’s just you and what you want to learn. Basically, after college, are you willing to put in the effort to study and learn without the impetus of tests.</p>

<p>The takeaway is to unlearn the association between success and hacking bad tests. Find tests where you win by doing good work, and that usually is in areas where tests are not delivered by an authority. Paul Graham cites two examples: startups and writing.</p>

<h2 id="hindsight-is-2020">Hindsight is 2020</h2>

<p><img src="https://kevinarifin.com/images/thought_bytes/instatweet.png" alt="" class="img-responsive img-container-center" /></p>

<p>With news coming out this week of Elizabeth Warren’s antitrust plan to regulate big tech, including the ability to undo previous mergers like Facebook/Instagram, <a href="https://twitter.com/balajis/status/1203200641788719105?s=12" target="_blank">this tweet</a> highlights how it is unfair to regulate these mergers in hindsight. Facebook made a tough decision in the moment, and that put them in a position to dominate the social media market today.</p>

<p>Looking at the rest of the thread further highlights the consensus that this was actually a poor decision by Facebook:</p>

<ul>
  <li>“Why would Facebook pay $1 billion for a company with no revenue?”</li>
  <li>“This is not going to be one of the best tech acquisitions of the next decade…Instagram is a photo service in a sea of other photo services.”</li>
  <li>“Can someone please tell me how Instagram’s actual content is worth anything?…Seems like mostly a huge waste of cash.”</li>
  <li>“At a market cap of $950M the New York Times is ‘worth’ less than Instagram.”</li>
</ul>

<p>Would the social media landscape be more competitive and innovative if Facebook, Instagram, and WhatsApp were separate entities? Absolutely. But instead of trying to undo the wrongs of the past, let’s come up with regulation to solve the problems of the future.</p>

<p>Ben Thompson’s <a href="https://stratechery.com/2019/a-framework-for-regulating-competition-on-the-internet/" target="_blank">article this week</a> provides an interesting framework to regulate tech. To explain the framework, it’s essential to understand aggregators and platforms.</p>

<ul>
  <li>Platforms: foundations for ecosystems - <em>Examples: Apple (iOS), Microsoft (Windows)</em></li>
  <li>Aggregators: collects critical mass of users to extract value from suppliers - <em>Examples: Google, Facebook</em></li>
</ul>

<p>Regulating platforms should focus on allowing 3rd parties to function on the platform (apps on the Apple app store), preventing rent-seeking (things like Apple charging 30% for all App Store transactions), and leveraging platform to gain market share in another vertical and give their own products and advantage (Micosoft Office documents only working with OneDrive and not Dropbox or Box).</p>

<p>Regulating aggregators should focus on preventing mergers-and-acquisitions with other Aggregators. Any other type of regulation (like what can be seen on Google shopping results) is like regulating consumer choice, and that is extremely difficult.</p>

<p>You can find more details on Ben Thompson’s regulation framework in his <a href="https://stratechery.com/2019/a-framework-for-regulating-competition-on-the-internet/" target="_blank">article</a>.</p>

<h2 id="communicate-like-a-ceo"><a href="https://www.sametab.com/blog/operations-and-internal-communication-strategies-for-effective-ceos" target="_blank">Communicate like a CEO</a></h2>

<p>I’ve always admired CEOs and leaders of successful organizations to inspire a large group of people to achieve a shared goal. Co-founder of Sametab Leonardo Federico shares <a href="https://www.sametab.com/blog/operations-and-internal-communication-strategies-for-effective-ceos" target="_blank">his insights</a> on what communication skills make effective CEOs, many of which translate to being a strong leader at work, in school, or on your own projects.</p>

<p>Leonardo starts the post with the fundamentals of effective communication. I try to distill these fundamentals into one blurb.</p>

<ul>
  <li>Motivating people is all about the why. Use narratives, not facts, to give context to the work being done and always explain why the work is important right now. And it’s not just sharing this context once - great leadership involves repeating the message over and over to the point “you grow sick of hearing yourself say it”, according to LinkedIn CEO Jeff Weiner.</li>
</ul>

<p>He provides some tools that facilitate for effective communication.</p>
<ul>
  <li>Lots of updates. A weekly team update (more tactical), metrics update (data-focused), an intangible update (focus on the big picture).</li>
  <li>A personal newsletter. Funny because I’m doing this right now. It adds a personal touch to leadership and let’s your employees know what’s on your mind this week outside of work.</li>
</ul>

<p>Check out the rest of the post <a href="https://www.sametab.com/blog/operations-and-internal-communication-strategies-for-effective-ceos" target="_blank">here</a> for more in-depth advice. Hope this gives you some good ideas to improve your own communication habits in whatever context you’re in.</p>

<h2 id="what-im-reading">What I’m Reading</h2>

<center>
    <img src="https://kevinarifin.com/images/thought_bytes/talkingtostrangers.png" class="img-responsive img-container-center" style="max-width:200px; margin-top: 5px" />
</center>

<p>I’ve read all of Malcolm Gladwell’s books in the past, and his book <em>Outliers</em> was one of the formative books during my high school times. I was excited when he released his new book <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Talking-Strangers-Should-about-People/dp/0316478520" target="_blank"><em>Talking with Strangers</em></a>.</p>

<p>The book challenges our ability to judge a stranger. From a Cuban agent rising up the ranks of the CIA and even being sent to Cuba as part of the CIA’s Distinguished Analyst program to British Prime Minister Neville Chamberlain believing Hitler’s lies in multiple face-to-face meetings, Gladwell highlights story after story of how our judgments of strangers are way off the mark.</p>

<p>The human tendency is to default to truth. It’s not that you don’t have doubts - it’s do you have enough doubts to call b.s.</p>

<p>In a world more divided than ever, it’s important to understand how we judge a stranger, and I’m looking forward to the insights Gladwell shares in the rest of the book.</p>
