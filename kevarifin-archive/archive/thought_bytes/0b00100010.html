                    <p>Merry Christmas from California! I’m enjoying some time at home away from the a surprisingly warm Chicago December. I spent the holiday playing a lot of poker, struggling to bake cookies, and consuming too much food at family holiday dinners.</p>

<p>I brainstormed an idea for the year in review piece, but didn’t get a chance to put it together so it will (hopefully) be included in next week’s newsletter.</p>

<p>Also, my brother Andrew is starting a newsletter. If you want to see thoughts and photography from the cooler Arifin, you can subscribe <a href="https://andrewarifin.substack.com/p/coming-soon" target="_blank">here</a>.</p>

<p>On to the newsletter ❄</p>

<hr class="after-post-hr" />

<h2 id="thought-bit-how-hard-should-you-work">Thought Bit: How Hard Should You Work?</h2>

<p>I came back to Twitter after a Star Wars spoiler hiatus to tweets and subtweets debating how hard you should work. While I found the debate tiresome on my feed, I thought both sides made some interesting points. People fell into two camps with some people making excellent points in the gray area:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p><strong>The 40 hour work week</strong></p>

    <p><strong>Key advocates</strong>: <a href="https://twitter.com/jasonfried/status/1209115637148274690" target="_blank">@jasonfried</a>, <a href="https://twitter.com/dhh/status/1209992915822333952" target="_blank">@dhh</a>, <a href="https://twitter.com/tobi/status/1210242188870930433" target="_blank">@tobi</a></p>

    <p>40 hours a week is plenty of time to get work done and employers shouldn’t ask you to work nights and weekends. Working to the bone only helps a VC 10x their money and you probably aren’t changing the world. Shopify CEO Tobi Lutke believes that everyone has about 5 hours a day of creative work and he hopes that 4 of those hours are channeled into Shopify. He’s home every night by 5:30 and spends time with his kids, playing video games, and prioritizing his health.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Success means working hard (probably more than 40 hours a week)</strong></p>

    <p><strong>Key advocates</strong>: <a href="https://twitter.com/auren/status/1209945192792350720" target="_blank">@auren</a>, <a href="https://twitter.com/twobitidiot/status/1209443243924045825" target="_blank">@twobitidiot</a>, <a href="https://twitter.com/paulg/status/1210191922310111233" target="_blank">@paulg</a></p>

    <p>Success is the result of working hard, and working hard probably means you’re working 60 hours a week and maybe nights and weekends. Auren Hoffman cites MLK, Gandhi, and Hamilton as individuals who worked tirelessly to change the world. Paul Graham can’t think of anyone that does great work but worked only moderately hard. To PG, it’s not about avoiding work, it’s about what your definition of work is.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>While I’m sure many people fall somewhere in between the spectrum of the two camps, I definitely side with the latter, especially if your objective function is to be the best at something.</p>

<p>In Bo Eason’s book <em>There’s No Plan B for Your A Game</em>, he challenges readers to make a declaration to be the best in some specific domain, tailored to what you want. This doesn’t mean a broad declaration like making the best company or being the best person. For Bo, it was being the best safety in the NFL (and he was until he blew out his knee).</p>

<p>Being the best version of you and your aspirations means you are doing something that’s so unique to you that there are no formulas for it. Who knows if the x hours of hard, focused work to achieve your dream 20 years down the line evenly divide out to 40 hours a week?</p>

<p>While I don’t have the credibility of a $50 billion company to back me up like Tobi Lutke, my opinion on how hard you should work is to do work that’s not work. I’m sure Tobi Lutke spent hours outside of his time officially working thinking about ways to improve his company, discussing ideas with other coworkers over drinks, or just hacking on improvements to Shopify outside of work.</p>

<p>Some would consider writing this newsletter as work, while I view it as just another part of my life, like working out, reading, or meditating. Do work that’s not work.</p>

<p>I would love to hear your thoughts on this debate!</p>

<h2 id="a-kara-swisher-interview-with-ben-horowitz-on-culture">A Kara Swisher interview with Ben Horowitz on Culture</h2>

<p>Kara Swisher recently interviewed Ben Horowitz about his new book <em>What You Do is Who You Are</em>. The book tells interesting anecdotes on building a strong company culture. If you’re unfamiliar with Ben Horowitz he was the former CEO of LoudCloud (a pre-AWS cloud infrastructure company) and co-founder of famous VC fund Andreessen-Horowitz (a16z).</p>

<p>When we think of company culture today, especially at tech companies, we think of plentiful snacks, ping-pong tables, and a relaxed dress code. But it’s important to remember how Silicon Valley ended up with this culture.</p>

<p>The pioneer of the culture Silicon Valley has today is Bob Noyce, former CEO of Intel. He realized that he had brilliant scientists and engineers working on semiconductors, but their ideas would never trickle to the top.</p>

<p>Noyce’s solution was to create a meritocracy where not just the people wearing $2000 suits are making the decisions, leading to a casual dress code. But forgetting the why leads people to treat work like home and show up to work in their pajamas.</p>

<p>It’s important to understand the implications of the culture you set, and how you can take a culture too far.</p>

<p>For Horowitz, these are his 2 do’s and don’ts for setting the culture of a company.</p>

<p><strong>Do’s</strong></p>

<ol>
  <li>Employees at a company should face the company culture every day, not just at the end of year review. The example he uses is Facebook’s “move fast and break things” culture, which engineers had to face on a daily basis.</li>
  <li>Culture is something you sign up for from the beginning. It can be explicit to the point where you have new employees sign an agreement to adopt the culture.</li>
</ol>

<p><strong>Don’ts</strong></p>

<ol>
  <li>Don’t do a brainstorm session about what the culture should be. The culture is a strategic decision made by the leaders of the company.</li>
  <li>Don’t reward people for not caring. Nothing destroys a culture more than someone who didn’t put in a lot of work getting rewarded over someone putting in a lot of effort.</li>
</ol>

<p>A recommendation from my dad, <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Everything-Store-Jeff-Bezos-Amazon-ebook/dp/B00BWQW73E" target="_blank"><em>The Everything Store</em></a> is the story of Jeff Bezos and Amazon. I’m only 40 pages in but already feel inspired reading about the origins of Amazon. A few thoughts:</p>

<ul>
  <li>I don’t spend enough time reading about successful companies and business people. While I’ve read books on the general history of Silicon Valley and some biographies (Elon Musk and Steve Jobs), I feel like there’s more to learn in terms of how to build a strong business, what habits made these individuals successful, and how they were able to look at the market opportunities differently. Even in the first 40 pages, you learn about Bezos’s mindset when hiring people, how he viewed the opportunity of being the largest store for everything, and what he believes makes Amazon different.</li>
  <li>There’s a certain obsessiveness about successful companies. Amazon is obsessed with the customer. You can see it in Bezos’s eyes in <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GltlJO56S1g" target="_blank">this interview</a>. This is emphasized many times in the book as well. To validate if Amazon would work, Bezos ordered a book online at one of the early online bookstores. It took a week to arrive and the book came a little tattered. That’s how he knew there was an opportunity for Amazon.</li>
</ul>
