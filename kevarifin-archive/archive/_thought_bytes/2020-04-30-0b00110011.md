It feels like my newsletter is turning from a Thursday newsletter to a Friday one. It's been a busy couple weeks and Thursday nights have been tiring. I've also enjoyed spending Friday evenings reflecting on the past few days as a capstone for the week.

We're launching a few exciting initiatives at Edith which have kept me busy, but I've enjoyed the opportunity to connect with a lot of students, chat and get feedback from mentors on the platform, and reconnect with old friends interested in learning more about Edith.

I share some of my big takeaways from the week and also a new book I'm reading. See you next week ✌️

## Startup Notes

Almost a year ago, I wrote this post about [impactful individuals](https://kevinarifin.com/impactful-individuals){:target='_blank'}. One of the things I said was "Do work that is not work" and after completing my second month of working on Edith full-time, that is more true than ever to me.

When you're working on a startup, you’re gonna be grinding, working a lot, sacrificing a lot of fun other things. But you do it because you want the company to survive and you believe in what you're building. Every decision you make, every task you do or don’t do impacts your startup's survival.

You’re also not being evaluated. Your evaluation is survival - do enough customers use what you're and do you generate enough revenue to become a business. There’s no boss to check in on you, no coach to tell you what you’re doing or how you’re doing, no manager to give you a promotion and a raise. You are boss, coach, and manager combined.

In a way this is a blessing and a curse. Curse in that it's stressful. That’s why it can’t be a job, because in a job, you’re naturally going to do enough to get by. But it's a blessing in that you control every aspect of the decision making: your voice, vision, and ideas are what coalesce into the company.

## What I'm Reading

I'm still in the middle of reading *Nudge*, but in a conversation with one of the mentors on Edith this week, he suggested a bunch of new books that seem quite interesting.

I'm starting with *The Subtle Art of Not Giving a F\*ck* by Mark Manson, the premise of the book being very similar to Tim Urban's post on [Taming Your Mammoth](https://waitbutwhy.com/2014/06/taming-mammoth-let-peoples-opinions-run-life.html){:target='_blank'}.

Basically, not caring about what people makes your life a lot more fulfilling - you pursue the things you care about and be true to what you believe in. It sounds obvious, but a lot of the time we don't even know we're being influenced by the people and ideas around us. It's always good to get a reminder of that, and I'm interested to see Mark Manson's take.
