Itâ€™s Star Wars week, and Iâ€™ve been hiding from the internet to avoid any spoilers and expectations.

I've found that any expectations coming into a new movie always impact my experience and overall opinion, so I want to come into the movie with as few external expectations as possible.

The sequel trilogy as a whole has been disappointing as my housemate Nick and I have often discussed, but I'm looking forward to seeing how they conclude it this Sunday.

Hope you have a good holiday and see you next week ðŸŽ„

## Thought Bit: Years in Review

It's that time of year when everyone writes, tweets, and instagrams about their year in review, and of course, I'm working on my own year in review post which I'll share in next week's newsletter.

In the meanwhile, here are some of my favorite "Year in Reviews" I've read this past week.

* [The 2019 Stratechery Year in Review](https://stratechery.com/2019/the-2019-stratechery-year-in-review/){:target='_blank'}

    This past year I became a loyal Stratechery subscriber, and if there's only one thing you read to get your tech news, Ben Thompson is your guy. His year in review mostly highlights some of the top articles he wrote this year so it's a great place to start to get an idea of his work and also get a snapshot of the big ideas in tech.

    From his framework for regulation, his definition of a tech company, and his continuing analysis of tech in terms of aggregators and platforms, it's surprising to see how much I learned from him this past year.


* [David Perell: Coolest Things I Learned in 2019](https://www.perell.com/blog/2019/12/11/coolest-things-i-learned-in-2019){:target='_blank'}

    David Perell's work was a huge reason I got into writing this past year. His year in review focuses on cool things he sent out in his newsletter. Some of my favorites:

    * A quote from Paul Graham: "A pattern I've seen in many different fields: even though many people have worked hard in the field, only a small fraction of the space of possibilities has been explored, because they've all worked on similar things. Even the smartest, most imaginative people are surprisingly conservative when deciding what to work on. People who would never dream of being fashionable in any other way get sucked into working on fashionable problems."

    * Pokemon is the top grossing media franchise.

    * And of course, Perell is a huge advocate for writing. In his own words: "Writing is the most scalable professional networking activity - stay home, donâ€™t go to events/conferences, and just put ideas down. Building your network, your audience, and your ideas will be something youâ€™ll want to do over your entire career. Think of your writing like a multi-decade project."

    I found this list from the [December 16th edition of Morning Brew](https://www.morningbrew.com/daily/2019/12/16){:target='_blank'}. It's a treasure trove of interesting stories and facts from the year. Some of my personal favorites:

    * #5: Baijiu is the worldâ€™s most popular spirit, with 10bn litres sold each year, almost entirely in China. The second most popular spirit in the world is vodka, with just 5bn litres sold.
    * #42: A man who bought the personalised number plate NULL has received over $12,000 of parking fines, because the system records â€˜NULLâ€™ when no numberplate has been recorded.
    * #50: Six reluctant Chinese hitmen who hired each other to carry out a murder went to jail when their outsourcing scheme collapsed. (You can find the whole story [here](https://edition.cnn.com/2019/10/22/asia/china-jails-men-outsource-murder-plot-intl-hnk/index.html){:target='_blank'})

In high school, I spent my spring breaks building homes in Tijuana, Mexico. 50 guys (I went to an all-boys high school) built 4 single-room homes in 5 days.

Non-profit [New Story](https://newstorycharity.org){:target='_blank'} recently completed the first homes in a 3-D printed neighborhood. 2-bedroom concrete houses to replace the shacks like the one pictured below built in 24 hours. All done using a 3-D printer.

A lot of innovation focuses on what makes the most money, leaving behind a lot of the developing world. It's inspiring to see this non-profit use innovations in 3-D printing to change the lives of people living in true poverty. Looking forward to see how the rest of the 3-D printed neighborhood project turns out.

## [Bill Gates on the Internet (in 1995)](https://twitter.com/TodayInSports3/status/1205854880906264577){:target='_blank'}

Before the internet was a thing, David Letterman asked Bill Gates some questions about how you could use the Internet. When David Letterman asked how he could use the internet, the interaction went along like this:

> **Bill Gates**: You could listen to a baseball game on your computer.
>
> **David Letterman**: Does radio ring a bell?
>
> **Bill Gates**: You can listen to the baseball game whenever you want.
>
> **David Letterman**: Do tape recorders ring a bell?

In hindsight, it's crazy to make fun of the usefulness of the internet. But I think it's more important to look towards the future and how we may make light of innovations that may change the world. Even services we take for granted today like Uber (Do taxis ring a bell?) or Airbnb (Do hotels ring a bell?) were met with a lot of skepticism at first.

It's interesting to think about what ideas are discounted by society today but could be a big part of the future. Crypto is what comes to mind at first. Would love to hear your opinions about things that are discounted but potentially world changing ideas!
