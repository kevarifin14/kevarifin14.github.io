If you're not an avid NBA fan, you probably have no idea who Spencer Dinwiddie is. But someday soon, you could invest in Spencer Dinwiddie (if you have lots of money).

For $150,000, you could buy one of 90 Dinwiddie tokens, giving you the rights to a percentage of his salary for the  2021-2022. There are two outcomes for this investment:
1. If he opts into his existing contract with a $12.3 million dollar salary, you'd see a 7.3% IRR.
2. If he signs a bigger contract, say $20 million dollars, you'd see a 10.6% IRR.

Dinwiddie is basically piloting equity investments in professional athletes. Buying into the Dinwiddie token would be making a bet that he'd improve over the next couple years. His hope is to expand this investment to other players as well, so you could invest in your favorite players like Zion Williamson or Stephen Curry.

## [A Spooky Cryptocurrency Tale](https://www.kalzumeus.com/2019/10/28/tether-and-bitfinex/){:target='_blank'}

Patrick McKenzie wrote a long piece on how [Tether is the largest fraud since Bernie Madoff's Ponzi scheme.](https://www.kalzumeus.com/2019/10/28/tether-and-bitfinex/){:target='_blank'} Here's a brief summary of the entertaining story.

**The players:**

* **Bitfinex**: The largest cryptocurrency exchange which lost $70 million to hackers in 2016. This is just the start of the crazy. To prevent the collapse of Bitfinex they:
    * Applied a 36% haircut to assets you held on the platform.
    * Replaced the 36% with a made-up asset called BFX representing how many dollars they owed you.
    * BFX dropped so much they offered to exchange BFX for equity in Bitfinex, with each BFX worth $1 in equity.
    * They then buy back the equity for $1. Unfortunately, they had a money problem so they used Tether.
* **Tether**: A stablecoin operated by Bitfinex, meaning one Tether was theoretically backed by one dollar. Stablecoins ease the transition between real-world money and cryptocurrency money. But Tether actually had no reserve to back their coins.
* **Crypto Capital Corp**: The largest client of Tether (where Tether theoretically put its currency reserves). Also Columbian drug cartels are clients of CCC. They would open and close accounts at banks with shady compliance controls. They never disclosed that several bank accounts were controlled by their principal architect Richard Fowler.

**The problems:**

1. In 2018, news that Tether wasn't backed by liquid cash led people to try to exchange their Tether for USD. Because nothing backed Tether, Bitfinex satisfied these requests using real customer money.
2. Now Bitfinex, instead of claiming 1:1 backing of Tether and currency, Tether reserves "may include other assets and receivables from loans made by Tether to third parties, which may include affiliated entities".
3. Without much real valuable things left, Bitfinex made another made-up utility token, which it sold, has some theoretical value, and is now being used to back Tether deposits.

So CCC is embezzling bank accounts that should be backing Tether. Tether can't be backed by real money, and instead now a mix of Bitcoin and Bitfinex's made-up assets. Bitfinex is paying withdrawals with real customer money.

## What I'm Reading

I'm reading another book in the Ender saga with Sarah, [*Ender's Shadow*](https://www.amazon.com/Enders-Shadow-Orson-Scott-Card/dp/0812575717/ref=sr_1_1?keywords=enders+shadow&qid=1572586409&sr=8-1){:target='_blank'}. It's a novel that occurs in parallel with *Ender's Game* but from another character's perspective (Bean).

It's interesting reading a similar story from a different perspective, as the author is able to explain certain plot points in the original book from Bean's perspective. As usual, Orson Scott Card does an amazing job developing another character. I highly recommend the book.
