Every new technology has a differentiator that makes things previously impossible, possible. The computer automated and by extension increased the computational capacity of a human. The phone put this computational power in our pockets, available anywhere, anytime. Now consider the blockchain. Ali Yahya, a partner at a16z crypto, argued that the differentiator for blockchain is trust. The blockchain allows for applications that require no trust between individuals in the exchange.
