I recently finished two books while on vacation: [*Loonshots*](https://www.amazon.com/Loonshots-Nurture-Diseases-Transform-Industries/dp/1250185963/ref=sr_1_2?keywords=loonshots&qid=1556856545&s=gateway&sr=8-2){:target='_blank'} by Safi Bahcall and [*How the Internet Happened*](https://www.amazon.com/s?k=how+the+internet+happened+by+brian+mccullough&crid=2VMKK73BEFR7I&sprefix=how+the+internet%2Caps%2C135&ref=nb_sb_ss_i_1_16){:target='_blank'} by Brian McCullough. I highly recommend reading the two books in tandem, starting with *Loonshots*. *Loonshots* gives the framework to analyze the rise and fall of internet companies, as franchise projects like the PC failed to see the rise of the internet and initial internet companies failed to cultivate the appropriate S-type loonshots to make successful businesses (more on what that means later). I'll cover some key takeaways and how the two books are interconnected in this post.

## *Loonshots*
> **Moonshot:** (1) The launching of a spacecraft to the moon; (2) an ambitious and expensive goal, widely expected to have great significance.
>
> **Loonshot:** A neglected project, widely dismissed, its champion written off as unhinged.

Loonshots are crazier than moonshots. While projects like the moon landing galvanized a whole country, loonshot projects like Leo Young and Hoyt Taylor's discovery of radar or Akira Endo's development of statin drugs were ignored by existing systems and faced a series of false failures. Loonshots are difficult to cultivate because both the idea and the individual will be challenged, but in hindsight, loonshots change the trajectory of wars, medicine, and the world. The challenge is not coming up with loonshot ideas; it's creating an environment that fosters their growth.

The key takeaway is the importance of structure when cultivating loonshots. Understanding the structure of a loonshot-friendly environment provides an interesting framework to analyze any human endeavor, from companies to countries. My favorite example of structure and loonshots Bahcall used was analyzing why Western Europe became the epicenter of what he calls the mother of all loonshots: the scientific method. In our west-centric world, we rarely think about the times when the Islamic Empire dominated science in the 10th century or how inventions like the printing press and gunpowder were first discovered in China. Why did the scientific method, and with it the Scientific and Industrial Revolution, start in Western Europe? The answer lies in structure. Bahcall argues that three conditions must be met for loonshots to flourish:

> 1. *Phase separation:* separate loonshot and franchise groups
2. *Dynamic equilibrium:* seamles exchange between the two groups
3. *Critical mass:* a loonshot group large enough to ignite

The structure of China and the Islamic Empire prohibited these conditions from being met. Ideas were born and destroyed at the whim of the emperor. Shen Kuo, a prominent Chinese scientist, had his explanations for the positions of planets deemed a danger to the Chinese franchise. Shen proceeded to spend the remainder of his life in exile. Contrast this with the small city-states in Western Europe. Tycho Brahe studied similar astronomical observations, but lost support from the Danish king. Instead of living the rest of his life in exile, he earned funding from the king of Prague, bringing in Johannes Kepler and continuing his studies. The small city-state leaders of Europe were willing to fund these future-looking, crazy projects, separate from running the franchise of their city-state. This also caused dynamic exchange of ideas not just within Western Europe, but with the Islamic Empire and China, bringing in technologies like mathematics, mining, and navigation.

These are important things to think about as we take a look at the state of our own country. Post World War II, America has established themselves as one of the premier nations on the back of military and technology loonshots, just as China and the Islamic Empire held that position in the 10th century. But has the United States become more and more like these powerful empires, than the innovative Western Europe? Let's look at these words from the Qianlong emperor.

> When the British approached China to expand trade in the eighteenth century, the Qianlong emperor wrote to King George III, "There is nothing we lack. We have never set much store on strange or ingenious objects, nor do we need any more of your country's manufactures."

These words sound ominously close to the mindsets of many politicians in today's United States. A growing anti-immigrant sentiment, an America-first approach to trade, and a backlash against the multicultural society we have created endanger the very loonshot nursery the United States has cultivated. If the country wishes to remain at the forefront of technology, we need to learn from the predecessing Islamic and Chinese Empires of the 10th century, and reflect on the structure we have created in this country.

## *How The Internet Happened*

Reading *How the Internet Happened* felt like living through a huge event in a movie like Thanos snapping his fingers or the Death Star blowing up, not realizing anything important was going on, and finally learning what happened. As someone born in the mid '90s I was barely cognizant for the rise and fall of the dot-com bubble. By the time I was old enough to appreciate technology, things like smart phones and social media had become ubiquitous. The internet has changed every part of our lives, and it is essential to understand the historical context of that change.

The key takeaways of the book revolve around two central ideas: why the internet has changed society the way it has and why internet companies have become the prototypical examples for the dynamic between loonshots and franchise projects.

***Why has the internet changed society the way it has?***

If I had to boil down the book to one four word quotation, it would be: "Unlimited selection. Instant gratification." This phrase perfectly encapsulates why the internet changed the world the way it has. Let’s work backwards. The iPhone culminated the maturation of the internet. It became the gateway to instant gratification and unlimited selection. From there we had access to products that embody these four words. Netflix gave us unlimited TV shows and movies, instantly bingeable. Facebook allowed us to instantly communicate with a basically unlimited number of friends. Through Google, we could instantly find any video or web pages from the infinite realm of the internet. The list goes on and on. But these companies weren’t always around. Before Netflix, there was Blockbuster. Google was predated by companies obsessed with the internet portal like Yahoo! and AOL. Facebook had Friendster and MySpace as its ancestors. And before that, we had a society doubtful of the change both the PC and internet would bring about. It’s almost comical to look at the words people used to describe the potential of the internet:

> When computers were first developed in the 1940s and ’50s, it was never imagined that the common man or woman would ever need, much less have use for, them. Computers were designed for big problems: calculating missile trajectories; putting a man on the moon. Thomas J. Watson once remarked, “I think there is a world market for maybe five computers."

No one expected the internet to change the world the way it has, and we weren’t ready for it. I recently read David Perell’s blog post [What the Hell is Going On](https://www.perell.com/blog/what-the-hell-is-going-on){:target='_blank'} and it does an amazing job of tying together the consequences of the internet. The abundance of information on the consumer side has transformed commerce, education, and politics in particular. It all goes back to unlimted selection and instant gratification. The internet has given us reviews and opinions from a multitude of perspectives on any product we purchase, any school we want to attend, and any politician or piece of legislation we are interested in. One part of the article really stuck with me:

> Narrative control is no longer monopolized. The arbiters of truth have fragmented. Millions of people, historically constrained by the reach and spread of their ideas, can theoretically reach anybody in the world with an internet connection. The truth has always existed, but until recently, we haven’t had the means to uncover and distribute it.

The internet didn't create the seemingly fragmented society we live in. The internet shined a light on a society as diverse as we truly are. The systems of mass media and politics are struggling to keep up with this drastic shift. The internet has allowed individuals to change these existing systems by democratizing the access and creation of information. There are still many industries the internet has yet to revolutionize, from smart city construction to mobile kitchens using autonomous delivery systems. Some of the craziest changes have yet to come.

***Why have internet companies have become prototypical examples for the dynamic between loonshots and franchise projects?***

When it comes to the internet, thinking about loonshots is unavoidable. The internet itself was a loonshot, a niche project many dismissed without any practical use besides sharing research papers. Before we analyze the internet in the loonshot framework, we need to go back to Bahcall's book and define some terminology.

Bahcall defines two types of loonshots:
> Let's call a surprising breakthrough in *product* -- a technology that was widely dismissed before ultimately triumphing -- a *P-type* loonshot... Let's call a surprising breakthrough in *strategy* -- a new way of doing business, or a new application of an existing product, which involves no new technologies -- an *S-type* loonshot.

The internet was the big P-type loonshot that once noticed (with the rise of Netscape), opened the door for many S-type loonshots. Industries like retail and media failed to see the internet coming in their rearview mirror, and have faced drastic changes as a result. Even Microsoft, enamored by their franchise PC and Windows operating system, nearly failed to make the appropriate pivots in the Internet Era. The internet as a P-type loonshot is what made headlines. But the most drastic changes the internet brought are in strategy.

The internet made impossible strategies possible. Make every song streammable for free (or a low monthly fee) for everyone? Spotify and Apple Music have done that. Borrow people's cars and houses to lend to complete strangers? Uber and Airbnb have done that. Have cars that send safety updates over the air? Tesla did that. These were strategies that were deemed crazy, if not impossible, and established industries like music producers and taxis challenged and continue to challenge their validity. Failure to recognize these strategies have doomed companies like Blockbuster and Toys“R”Us. Surviving chains like Walmart have only recently leveraged the internet to provide grocery pick-up and delivery services. The underlying theme across all companies, both existing ones that have adapted to the up and coming ones, is adopting strategies that leverage the internet to give consumers unlimited selection and instant gratification. The internet has changed the game. It's now time to play by the new rules.
