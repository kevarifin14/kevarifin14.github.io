Humans thrive on instant feedback. Fitbit started a national phenomenon by counting steps, encouraging wearers to reach 10,000 steps a day. Apple Watch owners are obsessive about completing their rings. When we know the effects of our actions in a quantitative manner, our behavior changes to the feedback. I’ve been obsessive about data since I was young. As a fifth grader, I would log stats from every workout I did: counting the number of shots made that day, logging reps completed in a 30 second jump rope drill, and tracking the number of free throws I’d hit in a row. Since my second year of college, I’ve religiously tracked my location using Moves (now defunct) and now Arc. I keep a budget of every expenditure and keep a monthly log of the activity on all my financial accounts. Data is the feedback to my life’s actions. It is also a motivator of change.

For anyone with health goals they want to reach, quantifiable feedback is essential. I made it a daily habit to log my weight and body fat starting in July 2018. Tracking my weight gave me the impetus I needed to improve my health. I made a bet with my friend [Nick](https://nickchua.me) to reach 10.4% body fat by November 15th, and that gave me a tangible goal as I measured my progress. Here is an interactive chart of my progress over the last several months.

From my peak in August to my lowest weight in mid-November, I lost more than 15 pounds and dropped more than 3 percent body fat. I’ve now stabilized about 10 pounds less than my peak and about 2 percent less fat. It’s fun to look back and see the progress I’ve made and continue to challenge myself to maintain that progress. Here are some things I focused on that helped me make that progress.

1. Intermittent fasting. I mainly did a morning fast, only drinking a smoothie (made of frozen berries, almond milk, bananas, spinach, vanilla protein powder, and [Raw Reserve](https://www.amazon.com/Amazing-Grass-Reserve-Superfood-Probiotics/dp/B004TJD72Q)) for breakfast. I would usually eat yogurt and fruit around 10 and then eat lunch and dinner normally around 12 pm and 6 pm respectively. I'm not a nutritional scientist, but there is reasonable [science](https://www.health.harvard.edu/blog/intermittent-fasting-surprising-update-2018062914156) behind intermittent fasting.
2. [Morning cardio workouts](https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/british-journal-of-nutrition/article/breakfast-and-exercise-contingently-affect-postprandial-metabolism-and-energy-balance-in-physically-active-males/9DAC8DE59DEEF7926E81FF2BB2C5B7EB/core-reader). One of the best times to work out is when your blood sugar levels are low. Sleeping is a natural fast, so your blood sugar is naturally low right when you wake up. Doing a light cardio  workout while your blood sugar is low forces your body to burn fat to fuel your body.
3. Improved diet. Part of this involved eating less; another part was eating smarter. I limited carbs and sugars (so few snacks and desserts). Meals were high in proteins, low in carbs, and as many veggies as possible.
4. More basketball. Cardio sucks, so find a sport that you enjoy so doing cardio is fun. Basketball is my sport of choice, but anything that gets your heart rate going does the trick.
5. Squatting twice a week. [Kevin D Lo](https://www.instagram.com/kevindlo/?hl=en) has been one of my fitness inspirations. He posted a great [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V9MfRv5Jzos&t=235s&frags=pl%2Cwn) on squatting and its benefits for losing weight and increasing muscle mass. Basically, your quads and glutes are the biggest muscles in your body. The stronger they are, the more calories a day they consume, helping you lose fat.

Health is an ongoing journey and I hope this post gives you somewhere to start your own data driven health journey.
