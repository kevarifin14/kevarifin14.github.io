After a week wearing the Apple Watch, I'm convinced it works. I took a break from writing this newsletter just to do an extra 8-minute ab circuit to get the max points in a day for my Apple Watch contest with [Nick](https://nickchua.me){:target='_blank'}.

We have a year long contest where each week we do an Apple Watch contest and every win counts as $10. At the end of the year we pay the net difference. We've both maxed out each day, but we've determined that the main challenge of our contest will be consistently keeping up a more intense activity level. Even if the wins net out to zero, hopefully we both see long term benefits for our health.

Besides the competitive social aspect of the watch for motivation, the watch also tracks some useful heart metrics that you can't get without your phone like resting heart rate (mine only went up 3 bpm to 45 in the last couple years so happy about that), heart rate variability, and heart rate (especially important during workouts to measure your intensity).

So far I'd give the Apple Watch a recommend. The main downside is it is another device to worry about and charge. I'm also not entirely used to it yet so I feel like I'm being watched every time I wear it. But if it makes me think about my health more of the day, it's more than worth the cost and extra attention required.

On to this week's newsletter.

## [**More Unbundling**](https://www.ben-evans.com/benedictevans/2019/9/27/new-productivity){:target='_blank'}

A common theme of the internet has been targeting a specific niche and distributing it everywhere at zero marginal cost. This has obviously been true of media. Content creators can target any interest, however mundane, and find an audience online.

The same can be said of the business. SaaS companies take a business problem, solve it better than any business can internally, and distribute it everywhere at no cost.

Anything that gets too big and too general gets unbundled because the internet allows you to target a specific audience. [Benedict Evans writes](https://www.ben-evans.com/benedictevans/2019/9/27/new-productivity){:target='_blank'} about how this new generation of productivity apps is the unbundling of Excel, Word, Powerpoint, and LinkedIn.

A few key points:

* Tools made to solve general problems (Excel for data store or LinkedIn for recruiting for example) are being unbundled to tools that solve specific use cases. Some examples from the article: [Everlaw](https://www.everlaw.com){:target='_blank'} pulls lawyers workflows out of spreadsheets and into their structured workflow and [Figma](https://www.figma.com/){:target='_blank'} takes the design job from a PC application to a collaborative web application.
* Just like every Craigslist category became an app, every Excel use case is going to be an app too. A web application to be more specific. The tools of tomorrow are all going to be online and collaboration first. But not only are they going to be online - they are going to be built specifically for the use case at hand.

## [**The Science of Progress**](https://www.theatlantic.com/science/archive/2019/07/we-need-new-science-progress/594946/){:target='_blank'}

We've made a lot of progress as humanity in our short existence. But we've never deliberately studied the science of progress. In this article by Stripe founder Patrick Collison and economist Tyler Cowen, discuss the need to understand the combination of economic, technological, scientific, cultural, and organizational advancement conducive to continuing the forward progress of civilization.

They pose some interesting questions.
* Progress has generally been concentrated in small regions throughout history. Ancient Greece way back in the day, China and Middle East in the 11th century, Florence for the Renaissance, Northern England for the Industrial Revolution, and Silicon Valley for the current technological boom. Why couldn't this happen in Boston or Japan? What made the Renaissance start in Florence?
* The current studies on productivity are quite split. Educating talented youth is an open question. The 10,000 hour rule (it takes 10,000 focused hours to master a skill) is constantly debated. There isn't enough engagement across disciplines to solve the problem of training people to push progress forward. The question is, can you deliberately make progress happen, or is a lot of progress happenstance?

## What I'm Reading

Bo Eason is an impressive individual. At age 9, he declared that he would be the best safety in the NFL and crafted a 20 year plan to make that happen. As a scrawny kid from a small town in the middle of nowhere, you could say this dream was longer than a long shot.

Fast forward 20 years later, and that dream was a reality. He was tackling wide receivers whose pictures used to be taped on the inside of his locker. He was competing for a starting spot with his childhood idol. The reason he got there: hard work.

There's a lot of definitions for hard work, but for Bo it means this: "focused, quality, rewarding effort and time that you put into moving yourself closer to your dream." I thought I worked hard when I practiced basketball to make the Varsity team, studied hard to do well at Berkeley, or pushing myself in my career. But Bo and the stories he shares show me that there is an even greater level of focus, quality, effort, and time to be the best.

I'm only a couple chapters in but I would definitely recommend [*There's No Plan B for your A-Game*](https://www.amazon.com/Theres-No-Plan-Your-Game/dp/1250210828){:target='_blank'}. Shout out to [Nick](https://nickchua.me){:target='_blank'} for lending me the book.
