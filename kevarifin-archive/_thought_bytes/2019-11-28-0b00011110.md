Happy Thanksgiving! I won't be sharing my usual collection of thoughts and articles in this week's newsletter, but wanted to thank you for being a part of Thought Bytes. Not everyone gets the opportunity to build an online audience, and I appreciate the time you take to read my weekly thoughts.

Sarah and I celebrated Thanksgiving together in Chicago. We spent the day running a 5k along the lake, eating dim sum, and working on a scrapbook while watching Home Alone. Here's a picture of our pasta + scallop dinner we cooked!

Wishing you a relaxing holiday with family and friends.
