Happy Thursday! I'm almost fully recovered from illness this week, but it looks like I have to be prepared to protect myself from coronavirus. Coronavirus fears have really picked up, with the S&P 500 losing $1.7 trillion in value and multiple countries in a state of emergency.

With a 2.8% mortality rate, the disease is a far cry from deadlier diseases like SARS or MERS. However, it's in the sweet spot of being both deadly and leaving enough survivors to transmit the disease, and it's not clear how easily transmittable the disease is.

I'm trying to stay optimistic about the economic and social impacts of the disease, as well as consume a balance mixed of coverage on the disease. I found this [Daily episode](https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/the-daily/id1200361736?i=1000466841517){:target='_blank'} to be a good summary of the situation. Stay healthy!

## Thought Bit: Formulas

These are a few tweets in a thread criticizing the tech interview process and the type of people they attract. As someone in the tech industry and very much lived that life, it got me thinking about this "formula for success" society has created.

Growing up in the Bay Area, it felt like there was a pre-drawn path for "success".

In high school, study hard for AP exams and SATs. Apply to college with the right mix of grades, extracurriculars, and test scores, and you'll get into a top school.

In college, get a good GPA, apply to the right clubs, and land the right internships. Spend hours on Leet Code preparing for coding interviews, and land a six-figure job at a top tech company.

Life is solved.

Or is it? The latest generation of students (including myself), spent the first 22 years and counting (with direct paths to big, comfortable tech companies) getting really, really good at tests (AP tests, SATs, coding interviews). Even, Paul Graham wrote about it in [this essay](http://www.paulgraham.com/lesson.html){:target='_blank'}.

Now, I’m not saying formulas are bad and everyone should drop out of school. But if you’re living the formula, take some time to think about what actually matters to you and what the formula says matters to you.

A common theme of many of the books I've been reading recently is the concept of finding that one specific thing that you can be the best at. Bo Eason in *There's No Plan B for Your A Game* calls it your declaration and 20 year plan. Phil Knight in *Shoe Dog* calls it your calling that you pursue with an athlete's determination. Jim Collins in *Good to Great* calls it the Hedgehog Concept and pushing the flywheel.

This isn't something you're taught in school. The only person that can teach you this lesson is you. Many of the founders of some of the most successful companies in the history of our country took unconventional paths. These unique experiences became fundamental in thinking differently to build special businesses. Which brings me to some words from Steve Jobs:

> You can't connect the dots looking forward; you can only connect them looking backwards

But what happens when you have no dots to connect? My fear is that our pursuit for a formula to success is that it ultimately leads us as a society to be unfulfilled, and ultimately fail. Maybe these thoughts are unfounded - only time will tell.

## What I'm Reading

In light of Bob Iger's stepping down as Disney's CEO, I've been reading his recently released memoir of his time as Disney CEO, [*The Ride of a Lifetime*](https://www.amazon.com/Ride-Lifetime-Lessons-Learned-Company/dp/0399592091){:target='_blank'}. Bill Simmons said the book was as good as *Shoe Dog* in terms of CEO stories, and so far it hasn't disappointed (though it did start a bit slow).
