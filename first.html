	I find it fitting I finish up my first post at the close of the first week of the Spring semester. I am oddly excited to embark on this new journey of blogging, having all my life been fairly averse to social media, not joining the mainstream likes of Twitter and Instagram. Several things bothered me about social media these days but I'll boil it down to one driving opinion. Social media has turned into a contest of likes. Many posts or comments seem so superficial in an attempt to garner the approval of peers. While there is nothing wrong with approval per se, I do believe we should all be our true selves not just in the virtual context but in day-to-day interactions as well.
