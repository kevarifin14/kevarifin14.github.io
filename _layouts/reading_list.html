      <p>
        Books, podcasts, and articles have been a way for me to expand my perspective and inspirations to think of new ideas and
        ways to solve problems. I'll keep a running list of some of my favorite media I've consumed.

      <h2>Books</h2>
        <p>
          This is a collection of all the books I've written about in my <i>Books I Like</i> series. If you want a more in-depth look
          at my thoughts on each book, follow the link to my post.

      <h2>Articles</h2>
        <p>
          As I compiled this list of articles, I realized how few articles have stuck with me long term, but the one's I remember have
          changed my life. I think it underscores the importance and difficulty of meaningful writing in a world where written media is all
          read and forget. Here are some of the few articles that have meant a lot to me.

      <h2>Podcasts</h2>
        <p>
          Podcasts are one of my favorite forms of media consumption. They are great ways to fill a routine walk or drive to work or
          a workout at the gym. I'm a regular listener of <a href='https://www.nytimes.com/column/the-daily' target='_'>The Daily</a>,
          <a href='https://exponent.fm' target='_'>Exponent</a>, and <a href='https://a16z.com/podcasts/' target='_'>a16z Podcast</a>,
          but these are a collection of some of my favorite podcasts I've ever listened to.
