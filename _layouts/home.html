        I first seriously thought about the idea of universal basic income last spring while taking Robert Reich’s Wealth and Poverty
        class my final semester at Berkeley. The class mainly focused on the growing socioeconomic inequality in the country and social
        policies that could fix the problem. While I agreed the problem was real, the solutions discussed seemed to be antiquated (labor unions),
        overly complex (earned income tax credit), or had misaligned incentives (disability and welfare programs). This is how I began to
        formalize the idea of universal basic income in my mind. It appeared to be a simple solution to solve the multitude of problems we
        face in today’s economy. While I’m no expert in social policy, my continued research of UBI showed it’s not only feasible, but
        something 2020 democratic presidential candidate Andrew Yang wants to make a reality. I discovered Andrew Yang through an interview
        he did on Sam Harris’s podcast Waking Up (now titled Making Sense). While Andrew Yang has many other policies, his most important
        platform is the Freedom Dividend, which will pay every citizen over the age of 18 $1,000 every month. There’s a lot to understand in
        terms of implementation and consequences so let’s explore his freedom dividend platform, and see how it makes him the most compelling
        candidate for president... <a href='/why-im-voting-for-andrew-yang' class='read-more'>Read More</a>

          When I first moved to college, I printed out Ben Jones's 50 Things article and pinned it up by my bedside. I would
          occasionally reread the article and reflect on how I was living my college life. To this day, I still do
          some of the things on the list like make a playlist for a chapter of my life (number 3). Inspired by
          his article, I decided to create my own list of things to do and think about while in college based on
          my experiences in undergrad...

            takeaways from the book. I’ll try to keep the spoilers to the minimum and focus more on why you should check these books

          Since graduating in May 2018, I’ve lived and worked in Berkeley, San Francisco,
          South Bay, Chicago, and New York. I’ve driven across the country and back, visiting Yellowstone,
          the Grand Tetons, and other national wonders, flying the same route across the country another five times...
