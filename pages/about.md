## About Me
![](/images/me.png){:class='img-responsive float-right img-container'}

*Life In Bytes* is a personal blog written by me, Kevin Arifin. I currently live in Chicago but grew up in the Bay Area.

I currently work at Citadel as a quantitative developer, with previous experiences as a software engineer at Zendesk and a small solar asset management startup. I attended undergrad at UC Berkeley studying EECS with a focus on statistics, machine learning, and algorithms.

I started *Life In Bytes* to share my perspective in an increasingly divided world. The focus of the posts will center around my musings in the intersection of society, politics, and technology, insights from collecting data about my life, and opinions about articles, podcasts, and books I've consumed. The goal is to post semi-regularly while I balance work, fitness, travel, and working on a side project (which I will write about when it is released).

## Teaching
I am passionate about educational opportunity and teaching. While at UC Berkeley, I taught an introductory data structures course ([CS 61B](https://sp18.datastructur.es){:target='_blank'}) and an upper division algorithms course ([CS 170](https://inst.eecs.berkeley.edu/~cs170/fa17/){:target='_blank'}). I was also president of [Berkeley Engineers and Mentors (BEAM)](http://beam.berkeley.edu){:target='_blank'}, a science and engineering mentoring organization.

## Interests
Besides my professional interests, I am a frequenter of reddit, a die-hard Star Wars fan, and an avid reader. I am passionate about fitness and health, and also spend time cooking, playing guitar, and eating fruits. I am oddly knowledgeable about the NBA (my friend challenged me to name at least five players from every team and I was able to) and spend brain downtime listening to various NBA podcasts like [The Lowe Post](http://www.espn.com/espnradio/podcast/archive/_/id/10528553){:target='_blank'} and [The Bill Simmons Podcast](https://www.theringer.com/the-bill-simmons-podcast).

## Acknowledgments
This blog would not be possible without the help of my friends and family. The logo an idea from my brother [Andrew](https://www.instagram.com/arifinphotography/){:target='_blank'}, and designed by my aspiring med student friend Tiffany. I have countless discussions with my housemate [Nick](https://nickchua.me){:target='_blank'}, who started a blog in parallel with me, that help both of us refine our ideas and challenge our beliefs. My girlfriend Sarah is my unpaid product manager who critiques all my posts. And of course, big thank you to my friends and family who were many of my first supporters of Thought Bytes.
