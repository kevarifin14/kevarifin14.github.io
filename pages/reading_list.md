Books, podcasts, and articles have been a way for me to expand my perspective and inspirations to think of new ideas and
ways to solve problems. I'll keep a running list of some of my favorite media I've consumed.

## Articles

As I compiled this list of articles, I realized how few articles have stuck with me long term, but the one's I remember have changed my life. I think it underscores the importance and difficulty of meaningful writing in a world where written media is all read and forget. Here are some of the few articles that have meant a lot to me.
