After a year in Chicago, I finally got the chance to watch Hamilton here. I've been obsessed with the musical since 2016 and I've listened to the soundtrack end-to-end 11 times and my favorite song in the play *Helpless* 742 times.

Hamilton is an interesting character and even though a lot of people disliked him, I admire his authenticity and intensity. He lived like he was running out of time, being George Washington's right hand man, creating the Central Bank, and writing the Federalist Papers. While his actions in his personal life leave much to be desired, he still did admirable things for our country and his legacy is felt today.

Here's a picture of the cast as everyone gave them a standing ovation.

On a side note, just when you think the NBA offseason is dying down, Russell Westbrook gets traded. I was already stunned Kawhi Leonard chose the Clippers and brought along Paul George. It's going to be a wild NBA season.

Hope you enjoy this week's newsletter. I share my thoughts on *Triumph of City*, a great podcast series by Naval, and an interesting article about living abroad. I've also started reading *Homo Deus* by Yuval Noah Harari. Until next week ✌️

## [**Cities from First Principles**](https://kevinarifin.com/city){:target='_blank'}

I finished *Triumph of the City* last week and it inspired me to reflect on the design and structure of cities and their impacts on people. I wrote a post compiling what I learned from the book and my own experiences exploring cities of what I believe are the building blocks of a successful city.

1. **Designed for people**

    Cities are built for human scale. This requires density and mixed-use buildings. Human scale cities are stimulating, with your environment constantly changing as you walk just one block and other people darting past you to get to their destination.

2. **Empowering people**

    Cities empower people to find better careers, build relationships, and live greener lives. Cities attract talent and promote the random spread of ideas. The density of urban cities allows people to walk, bike, or train instead of driving, which is at least 10 times more clean in terms of carbon footprint.

## [**Naval Podcast**](https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/naval/id1454097755){:target='_blank'}

I tweeted this past week about how every once in awhile, I find someone whose ideas change my life. A couple years ago, I discovered Tim Urban's site [Wait But Why](https://waitbutwhy.com). Another individual whose ideas I feel will change my life is Naval. I listened to a conversation between Naval and Joe Rogan (my notes on that conversation can be found [here](https://kevinarifin.com/naval){:target='_blank'}), and I've been thinking about his ideas ever since.

He has a series of [mini-podcasts](https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/naval/id1454097755){:target='_blank'} where he discusses his ideas and I've been slowly working my way through them (about 25% of the way through). They're concise and insightful, and I highly recommend listening - he has some life-changing ideas.

Some of my favorite insights so far:
* Your advantage is being authentic. Just like Tim Urban talks about [taming your mammoth](https://waitbutwhy.com/2014/06/taming-mammoth-let-peoples-opinions-run-life.html){:target='_blank'}, Naval talks about how everyone's unique strength comes from being completely yourself. No one can beat you at being you; if you just do what everyone else is doing, it's hard to compete.
* Leverage yourself. Develop skills that give you 10x the output. An example he uses is comparing a the best lumberjack to the average lumberjack. Maybe he outputs 30% more lumber, but the outcome in both compensation and results is roughly the same given similar effort. But the best software engineer leverages automation allowed by computers and is exponentially more productive than an average one.

## [**Maybe I Should Live Abroad**](https://hbr.org/2018/05/how-living-abroad-helps-you-develop-a-clearer-sense-of-self){:target='_blank'}

This [article](https://hbr.org/2018/05/how-living-abroad-helps-you-develop-a-clearer-sense-of-self){:target='_blank'} from the Harvard Business Review argues that living abroad helps enhance creativity, reduce intergroup bias, and promote career success. That's something I can agree with.

When abroad, you are surrounded by completely different people with different values and upbringings. It forces you to constantly challenge your own identity and strengthen you sense of self. I definitely feel this when I go abroad, even if it's only for a couple weeks. From Parisians enjoying there 3 hours dinners over wine to Balinese working hard day to day just to get by, people around the world live such contrasting lives.

Being abroad, you are also on your own. You have few, if any, friends and your daily routine completely changes. It forces you to recalibrate and figure out what matters to you. In the same environment, it's all too easy to get into a comfortable routine and keep living the status quo.

It was an interesting read, and backed up some of my convictions about the benefits I've felt from moving halfway across the country. I can only imagine the self-learning that would result from moving abroad.

## What I'm Reading

I read Yuval Noah Harari's book *Sapiens* awhile back, but never got around to reading his sequels, [*Homo Deus*](https://www.amazon.com/Homo-Deus-Brief-History-Tomorrow/dp/0062464345/ref=pd_lpo_sbs_14_img_1?_encoding=UTF8&psc=1&refRID=YSJP2PT8RX09Z11V4PVN){:target='_blank'} and [*21 Problems for the 21st Century*](https://www.amazon.com/Lessons-21st-Century-Yuval-Harari/dp/0525512179){:target='_blank'}.

Harari is a historian and lecturer at the Hebrew University of Jerusalem. He provides excellent insights into applying his knowledge of history to understand the problems of today. In *Homo Deus*, he focuses on how we are transitioning from homo sapiens to homo deus. In the 20th century we solved the problems of homo sapiens:
1. Hunger
2. Disease
3. War

In the 21st century, we are tackling the problems that will make us homo deus:

1. Eternal life
2. Happiness
3. Divinity

I'm excited to see how this book plays out, and look forward to sharing my insights on the book in a future post.
