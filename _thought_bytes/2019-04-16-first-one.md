**Welcome to the first ever issue of Thought Bytes!** Thank you for being an early adopter and supporter of my work. The first Thought Bytes features a deep dive on Andrew Yang and his Freedom Dividend policy.

I first seriously thought about the idea of universal basic income last spring while taking Robert Reich’s Wealth and Poverty
class my final semester at Berkeley. The class mainly focused on the growing socioeconomic inequality in the country and social policies that could fix the problem. While I agreed the problem was real, the solutions discussed seemed to be antiquated (labor unions), overly complex (earned income tax credit), or had misaligned incentives (disability and welfare programs). This is how I began to formalize the idea of universal basic income in my mind. It appeared to be a simple solution to solve the multitude of problems we face in today’s economy. While I’m no expert in social policy, my continued research of UBI showed it’s not only feasible, but something 2020 democratic presidential candidate Andrew Yang wants to make a reality.

I've been working my way through <a href='https://www.amazon.com/Loonshots-Nurture-Diseases-Transform-Industries/dp/1250185963' target='_blank'>*Loonshots*</a>, a recommendation I got from an <a href='https://a16z.com/2019/03/24/loonshots-moonshots-incentives-org-innovation-big-small-phase-transitions/' target='_blank'>
a16z podcast</a>. It has been a great read so far, big on history and how we can learn from these historical successes and failures to identify
crazy ideas that could transform an industry or the world. I'll write more on the book when I finish it as part of my *Books I Like* series.
