Greetings from Chicago! It's been a long week but I've got some exciting things in the works to share with you over the next couple weeks.

For those not following the Democratic primaries, the 4th debate happened this past Tuesday, and Andrew Yang helped drive a discussion about automation and Universal Basic Income. The momentum behind his campaign is growing and people are really rallying behind the message of his campaign to move the country forward, not left or right.

I've been branching out a little bit with my workouts to diversify my fitness training. I did my first [Peloton](https://www.onepeloton.com){:target='_blank'} class this week. It surprisingly exceeded my expectations and was a better experience than my two in-person spin classes (one at an Equinox and one at a FlyWheel). I also did my first in-home yoga class as I'm trialing a subscription of the yoga app [Glo](https://www.glo.com){:target='_blank'}.

My first several experiences of virtual fitness classes sparked an interesting idea about how to revolutionize the at-home fitness market, and I'm excited to share my thoughts in an essay I will publish next week. Enjoy the newsletter and see you then ✌️

## What Happened to All Our Stuff?

Ran into one of my favorite GIFs of all time on Twitter this past week. It's a bit dated and apps have continued to de-stuff even more of our lives, but it's really crazy to think how multi-functional our devices are nowadays.

## [Instability in 5 Dimensions](https://twitter.com/andrewm_webb/status/1176204000821202945?s=12){:target='_blank'}

I wrote a brief [summary](https://kevinarifin.com/spacetime){:target='_blank'} of some things I learned from Stephen Hawking's book *A Brief History of Time*, one of which was why our world is 3-dimensional.

One of the arguments is that planetary orbits are unstable in 5 dimensions. This GIF is a great visualization of this concept.

## [How to Read a Lot](https://qz.com/895101/in-the-time-you-spend-on-social-media-each-year-you-could-read-200-books/amp/){:target='_blank'}

[This guy](https://qz.com/895101/in-the-time-you-spend-on-social-media-each-year-you-could-read-200-books/amp/) reads 200 books a year. The key? Not going on social media and an environment that makes it easy to read.

Some quick math:
* 200 books * 50,000 words/book = 10 million words
* 10 million words/400 wpm = 25,000 minutes
* 25,000 minutes/60 = 417 hours

The average American each year spends:
* 608 hours on social media
* 1642 hours on TV

Replacing 2/3 of your social media time with reading would allow you to read 200 books a year.

I've found this generally to be true, especially if I put myself in an environment conducive to reading.
* I've deleted all social media apps from my phone, forcing me to go to the browser to use them. I also add screen time limits and place the apps I do have in inconvenient spots on my phone.
* The Books app is right on my dock with one of the books I'm currently reading loaded in the app. Any spare moment I have, it's easier to open Books rather than a social media app.
* I have books lying around the house and habit stack reading with daily activities like drinking my morning smoothie or eating meals.

I'm not reading 200 books a year, but eliminating wasted time on social media and making it easy to replace with reading time has definitely been beneficial for my personal growth.

## Wise Words

Speaking of books, a great quote from my What I'm Reading book *There’s No Plan B For Your A Game* last week:

> “So many people are just running around and distracted all day, every day. They get to the end of a twenty-year cycle and then wonder why they’re so exhausted but nothing has really changed… Instead of being loyal to the one thing you should be loyal to, which is your dream, your declaration, you’re letting distractions invade your environment.”

Sarah started reading my favorite book *Ender's Game* so I thought I would reread the book with her. This is my third reread of the book (I'm surprised I haven't read it more), and the story still resonated with me.

My favorite line from the book speaks the main message of *Ender's Game*:

> I think it’s impossible to really understand somebody, what they want, what they believe, and not love them the way they love themselves.
