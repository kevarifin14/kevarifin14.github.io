Another week, another Thought Bytes. Thank you for being an early adopter of my newsletter, and I appreciate any feedback you have to improve my work and make Thought Bytes more personally valuable to you.

I finished *Atomic Habits* this past week and I cannot recommend the book enough. My first post inspired by the book is featured in this newsletter, and I hope it inspires you to do your own Identity Challenge (more on that below).

I received good feedback about [part 1](https://kevinarifin.com/monetizing-the-internet-1){:target='_blank'} of my *Monetizing the Internet Series* and part 2 the series will be coming next week. Really excited about how this series is turning out and hope it gives you a new perspective on how the internet works today.

See you next week ✌️

[Atomic Habits](http://www.jamesclear.com/atomic-habits){:target='_blank'}

After finishing *Atomic Habits* by James Clear, I was inspired to write a couple posts based on my favorite ideas from the book. The first post focuses on identity. Behavior change starts with your identity and the processes that come to provide evidence for who you are. The ultimate outcomes, whether your goal is to lift 3 plates on the deadlift or get a raise, come naturally with defining your new identity and process. This post is a challenge to define your identity: who you are, who you want to be, and who you don't want to be. If you choose to publicly participate in my [#identitychallenge](https://twitter.com/kevarifin/status/1133602524542504967){:target='_blank'}, link me your post and I'll share it in future newsletters!

With June right around the corner and with it, the first Democratic National Committee debate, it's time to talk about Andrew Yang again. He's a candidate that's received coverage from inceasingly prominent media outlets, recently cracking the [top 10](https://www.cnn.com/2019/05/23/politics/2020-rankings-biden-warren-harris-buttigieg-sanders/index.html){:target='_blank'} in CNN's rankings of 2020 democratic candidates. I [wrote](https://kevinarifin.com/why-im-voting-for-andrew-yang){:target='_blank'} about why his Freedom Dividend policy makes him the most compelling candidate back in April. Andrew Yang also embodidies genuineness not seen in any other politician. His ability to relate to his supporters resonates a lot with me, and he wrote a powerful [piece](https://www.yang2020.com/blog/trust-the-process/){:target='_blank'} on what it's like to be an introverted politician.

## [**Smart People Talk About the Internet**](https://www.wired.com/story/artificial-intelligence-yuval-noah-harari-tristan-harris/){:target='_blank'}

Tristan Harris, founder of [Center for Humane Technology](https://humanetech.com){:target='_blank'}, is one of the foundational thinkers for many of my posts, particularly [*Monetizing the Internet*](https://kevinarifin.com/monetizing-the-internet-1){:target='_blank'}. He participates in an excellent [interview](https://www.wired.com/story/artificial-intelligence-yuval-noah-harari-tristan-harris/){:target='_blank'} for *Wired* that I mention in my post. I highly recommend checking it out as he provides an interesting perspective on how technology has changed human behavior.

I played a lot of *Civilization V* in my last semester of college; a little too much maybe. But it sparked a long dormant interest in history that I'm finally acting on. [*Guns, Germs, and Steel*](https://www.amazon.com/Guns-Germs-Steel-Fates-Societies/dp/0393317552){:target='_blank'} is an interesting read on why the world turned out the way it did. While it may seem obvious that transitioning from hunters and gatherers to agriculture was the way to go, Jared Diamond goes in-depth analysis on why that decision was not as simple as it seemed and how environmental factors impacted this transition.
