Happy Friday! Sorry the newsletter is a day late - Sarah flew into Chicago last night and we were relaxing and watching *Star Wars: Clone Wars*. I'm super excited for the last season of *Clone Wars* coming to Disney+ next Friday.

This week was particularly sad with Andrew Yang dropping out of the 2020 race. After two tough outcomes in Iowa and New Hampshire, it made sense to suspend his campaign and focus on the next battle. While the 2020 campaign is over, the ideas he fought for, a universal basic income and human-centered capitalism, continue to live on. I spent some time to reflect on his campaign. You can find my thoughts in the next section.

On to the newsletter!

## [Thought Bit: What the Andrew Yang Campaign Meant to Me](https://kevinarifin.com/thank-you-andrew-yang){:target='_blank'}

*This is from my short post on Andrew Yang after he suspended his campaign that can be found [here](https://kevinarifin.com/thank-you-andrew-yang){:target='_blank'}.*

When I first listened to Andrew Yang on an interview with Sam Harris back in October 2018, I knew he was my candidate. He instantly made me interested in the 2020 Presidential race, but above all, instantly felt like someone who could truly change this country for the better.

The campaign started small. I still remember telling friends about Andrew Yang and getting crickets in response. But slowly he caught on. My brother and I bought “First 500” hats. My friend Wayne became an organizer for Oakland Yang Gang. My girlfriend Sarah donated to his campaign, sent me tweet after tweet about his campaign, and was heartbroken when he dropped out. People were listening.

There was a period of time, where I listened to every single Andrew Yang interview out there. This was before he became too big and was just doing podcast interviews. Sam Harris interview. The big Joe Rogan interview. A conversation with Ben Shaprio. Andrew on the H3 podcast, on Kara Swisher, on the Asian America podcast, Eric Weinstein, Off the Pill (with Niga Higa!). If Andrew was speaking, I had to listen.

I believed in a lot in his policies, the big one being universal basic income, or the Freedom Dividend as he called it. It was such a simple idea, yet would solve a lot of the problems our society faces today.

But continuing to listen to him talk, it went beyond policies. I once reflected on my all-time inspirations list. Elon Musk, Steve Jobs, Kobe Bryant. Andrew Yang skyrocketed up there. I never thought an Asian man running for president would be name-dropped on my list of inspirations.

I never in my life thought I could run for President, but in a weird way, his campaign made me feel like I could do it (not that I would want to). There was something oddly empowering with the way he carried himself as a normal person, pursuing a goal against all odds, and standing up to the establishment with ideas backed by numbers and logic.

So many of Andrew’s qualities are qualities that I aspire to have. I started modeling my public speaking after him. Just as I channel my inner Steph Curry when I shoot, when I speak I channel my inner Andrew Yang. The humanness, the emotion he would show on stage, the love he would share for his family, the entrepreneurial spirit and energy, the attentiveness he would bring to every conversation - those are all qualities I admire and aspire to emulate.

Our country needs Andrew Yang the human. Thank you Andrew for what you’ve started - this is just the beginning.

## [Reading Notes: The Innovator's Dilemma](https://kevinarifin.com/reading_notes/the-innovators-dilemma){:target='_blank'}

I finished *The Innovator's Dilemma* recently and published my [reading notes here](https://kevinarifin.com/reading_notes/the-innovators-dilemma){:target='_blank'}. Each reading note has the same framework of 3 ideas, 2 quotes, and 1 takeaway from the book.

My big 3 ideas from the book:
1. Disruption occurs when entrants create value on different dimensions
2. The value networks companies focus on are both their strengths and limitations
3. Markets that do not exist cannot be analyzed and are smaller than they appear

## What I'm Reading

![](https://kevinarifin.com/images/books/shoe-dog.jpg){:class='img-responsive img-container-center'}

*Shoe Dog* is Phil Knight's memoir of founding Nike. Four pages into the book and I was immediately inspired. One of my favorite lines:

> Find some prodigious, improbable dream that seemed worthy, that seemed fun, that seems a good fit, and chase it with an athlete’s single-minded dedication and purpose.

Phil's message throughout the book is don't stop. You realize how many points Nike seemed hopeless. Blue Ribbon (the company name pre-Nike) going to the distributor to fight for distribution rights. A Japanese businessman backstabbing them and pulling the rug on their shipments and exclusivity deal. Phil constantly running out of money and struggling to get loans from various banks.

These stories of founders building their companies feel like movies and understanding the challenges that went into building these companies we take for granted today is humbling and inspiring.
