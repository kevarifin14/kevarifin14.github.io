It's been a busy week as I'm sleep deprived and writing this hours before midnight central time. But I always look forward to this time of the week to reflect back on what I've learned, how I've grown, and how I've fostered my relationships with others.

This past week was my brother Andrew's graduation from UCLA, allegedly the #1 public university. He is the source of all the good pictures on my website (the bad ones are mine).

Here is a photo of us from grad -- I was so excited to take a picture in front of this wall full of bits! I'm super proud of everything he's accomplished. He's like the cool version of me - a talented [photographer](https://www.instagram.com/arifinphotography/){:target='_blank'}, plans to work at Apple, and is regent of his frat Theta Tau.

That's it for this week. I hope you check out my essay on impactful individuals -- it's one of my favorites I've written so far. I'm also working on Part 3 of my Monetizing the Internet series. If you haven't read Part 2, you can find it [here](https://kevinarifin.com/monetizing-the-internet-2){:target='_blank'}. As always, I appreciate your support and I'm excited to continue seeing this newsletter grow. Cheers ✌️

Through all of my reading, learning, and interactions with others, I've noticed four trends shared among what I call impactful individuals.

Being an impactful individual means you are somone who has a major effect on other people, things, or actions. These are the four trends of impactful individuals:

1. Read a lot.
2. Write a lot.
3. Do work that is not work.
4. Synthesize ideas from different fields.

If you want to dig a little deeper into how these trends help you become a more impactful individual, you can read more [here](https://kevinarifin.com/impactful-individuals){:target='_blank'}.

## [Life Is Short](http://www.paulgraham.com/vb.html){:target='_blank'}

This week's [Paul Graham essay](http://www.paulgraham.com/vb.html) reminds us that life is short. His solution is simple: cut the bullshit. Stop caring about what other people think about you, do things you care about, and spend time with the people that matter.

An example he uses to contextualize the shortness of life is counting the number of times that event will occur in your life. You get eight Christmas days where you believe in Santa. You have about sixty winters left (in Chicago, this seems like a good thing). Once you graduate high school, you've spent about 93% of your in-person time with parents.

These concepts remind me a lot of one of my favorite Wait But Why articles called [The Tail End](https://waitbutwhy.com/2015/12/the-tail-end.html){:target='_blank'}. Check it out for more profound numbers detailing how short life is.

I've always been fascinated by Leonardo da Vinci. He was the prototypical renaissance man: an artist, engineer, architect, entertainer, and scientist. While he was born as an illegitimate child, homosexual, and left handed, he was successful not in spite of his circumstances, but because of them.

His unorthodox upbringing and unmatched intellectual curiosity led him to explore anything that piqued his interest and synthesize inventions and solve problems in a diverse set of fields. He carried around a notebook and jotted down observations as he went about his day. Every inch of paper was covered in notes since paper was so precious. It makes me wonder how he would interact in today's world with easy access to information and so many tools to observe the world.

Walter Isaacson does a great job portraying the curiosity and diverse talents of Leonardo da Vinci. If you're someone who's a fan of Leonardo da Vinci, definitely check out [this biography](https://www.amazon.com/Leonardo-Vinci-Walter-Isaacson/dp/1501139150){:target='_blank'}.
