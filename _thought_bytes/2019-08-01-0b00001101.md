Happy Friday. A little late sending the newsletter but life happens and Sarah and another good friend from home Cem flew in last night so I wanted to maximize my time with them.

We ate at Kizuki Ramen last night for their first meal in Chicago. It’s one of my favorite restaurants in Chicago and their chicken karage is a must-have.

A brief meditation update. Since I've started meditating, I've successfully did my minute meditation 10 out of the last 12 days. Developing the "show-up" portion of the habit is going pretty well and thinking soon about doubling my meditation time. More to come next week on this progress.

## [**Netflix, Disney, and Streaming Video**](https://redef.com/original/the-streaming-wars-its-models-surprises-and-remaining-opportunities){:target='_blank'}

It's hard to understand the streaming video industry. At first glance, it seems like all the companies are competing with the same business models: replacing TV to become your primary source of visual entertainment. However, there is way more nuance in how the industry actually works.

Matthew Ball rights an awesome [piece](https://redef.com/original/the-streaming-wars-its-models-surprises-and-remaining-opportunities){:target='_blank'} consolidating his insights on the industry.

As the industry has matured over the last couple years, Matthew Ball (who is probably the most bullish person on Netflix), separates Netflix into a business model of its own. They are the only business where streaming video is their primary goal and are an aggregator of video content.

Other companies like Disney/Hulu, Apple, or Amazon use their streaming video as anchors to their existing business. It's just incremental revenue as you buy into their other services and products.

This distinction is why Matthew Ball is so bullish on Netflix. While it seems like the industry is crowding with so many new players, Netflix is the only one who is all-in on aggregating and creating content.

## A Bit about Augur

![](https://kevinarifin.com/images/thought_bytes/augur.png){:class='img-responsive img-container-center'}

I’ve been following developments in blockchain and decentralization over the past year. One of the reasons I think the industry has yet to become practically useful is because it’s hard to understand clear applications of the technology.

This week I wanted to highlight one of my favorite use cases of blockchain. [Augur](https://www.augur.net){:target='_blank'} is a decentralized prediction market and consensus system.

Users create markets with clear deadlines and outcomes, like “Who will be the next US President?” or “Which team will win the NBA championship?”. Users can purchase and trade shares with Ethereum (the second most popular cryptocurrency) in each outcome and then trade these shares with other users.

When the outcome is resolved, Augur uses a decentralized why of coming to a consensus on the outcome. Verifiers declare an outcome; for example, the Raptors won the NBA championship. They stake Augur's in-house token called Reputation token on the outcome. Whatever outcome has the most Reputation token staked on it is declared the consensus outcome. Those who agreed on that consensus outcome share in the total Reputation staked across all outcomes.

With a consensus outcome, participants who own shares in the winning outcome can now receive Ethereum for their winnings.

## Bullish on Twitter

[Twitter](https://twitter.com/home){:target='_blank'} is a social network disguised as a professional network, if you follow the right people. It’s full of founders, VCs, and writers sharing what they read and a slice of their thoughts.

People are also much more willing to engage on Twitter in a candid yet professional manner than platforms like LinkedIn. I’ve exchanged DMs with the founder of Basecamp, talked with aspiring entrepreneur Tomiwa, and grabbed coffee with experienced startup consultant Patrick McKenzie.

Give me a follow if you make a Twitter ([@kevarifin](https://twitter.com/kevarifin){:target='_blank'}) and feel free to DM me for some individuals I recommend following.

## Yang Update

As many of you know, I’m a huge supporter of [Andrew Yang](https://www.yang2020.com){:target='_blank'}. I’ve had multiple people message me over the past couple months telling me they started following his platform and are now supporting him as well, which makes me super happy and excited for his campaign.

During this week’s debates, despite still receiving the least amount of talking time, he made his point to a large group of people, raising 500k from 20000 donors.

He may still be longer than a long shot, but his message speaks to large and diverse demographic of individuals. If you aren’t familiar with Andrew Yang and his flagship Freedom Dividend, I wrote about it [here](https://kevinarifin.com/why-im-voting-for-andrew-yang){:target='_blank'} and I recommend checking out his [interview](https://www.yang2020.com/blog/the-joe-rogan-experience/){:target='_blank'} with Joe Rogan.
