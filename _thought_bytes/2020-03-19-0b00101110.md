##  On Investing in People

![](https://kevinarifin.com/images/chicago.jpeg){:class='img-responsive img-container-center'}

Throughout a lot of my life, I always gravitated towards positions of teaching and mentorship.

In high school, I spent a lot of my summers as a basketball camp coach.

In college, I spent most of my non-academic time running a science and engineering mentorship organization and teaching computer science courses.

Even post-college as I started a full-time role at Citadel, I always volunteered to be an intern buddy or talk with college students considering a role at the firm.

What drew me to the experiences was a sense of giving back. At every step of the way, I’ve had people shape my education, career, and life for the better. I had parents that helped me pay for school, gave me the freedom to make mistakes, and also kept me on the right track. I was fortunate to have friends a year or two older in school that pushed me to try computer science, which was something I enjoyed studying and also set me up for a good career out of school.

People underrate how much value their experience can bring to people aspiring to be in their position. Much of the advice I received, like starting a four-year plan for classes, writing a strong resume, and preparing for interviews, was a short conversation with a friend or mentor but helped me a lot in my academic and professional career.

But both finding and having access to these mentors is a lot of happenstance and circumstance. Not all kids are born into families that can afford to pay for school. Not everyone went to a high school with an alumni network to connect with as you pick a college, select your first classes, and pick a major. Not everyone finds a mentor at work to help them jumpstart their career.

That’s what led me to work on a startup that’s making the platform to invest in human potential. I envision a world where you can leverage your potential to access both capital and mentorship to pursue your education, find a fulfilling career, or start your own company. It's a world that drives investment to those that are underinvested and people can take bets on themselves and on the people they believe in.

This world already kind of exists today in the venture capital world, but it’s heavily gated by signaling and location. Most of the top VCs are in the Bay Area, and they look for founders with a proven track record, work experience from top startups and companies, or the best academic acumen. But the model of investing in a company’s equity is what makes these VCs generous with their mentorship. From Paul Graham, one of the most famous VCs in Silicon Valley:

> Investors are different—-not because they’re more generous spirited than other people, but because they get equity. Tell investors you’re going to start the next Google and they immediately perk up. They don’t default to skepticism, because they like risky bets. And they don’t feel like you’re trying to put yourself above them, because they hope to be drawn up with you.

When people can invest in other people, startup founder or not, it unlocks a world of mentors that want to share in your success. It takes the happenstance out of finding a mentor, because people are going to want to find the people they believe in and back them.

This is what my co-founder [Nick](https://nickchua.me){:target='_blank'} and I are building at Edith Labs.

If my story behind Edith Labs resonates with you and you would like to be a mentor, either financially invested in a student or not, don’t hesitate to reach out at [kevin@edithlabs.com](mailto:kevin@edithlabs.com){:target='_blank'}.
