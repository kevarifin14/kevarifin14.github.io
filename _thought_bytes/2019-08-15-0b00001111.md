I started writing my newsletter Wednesday night summarizing an article I read this week, but ended up writing something completely orthogonal and growing it into a new essay. I've recently felt uninspired in my writing, but many ideas came together from my recent reading and podcast listening and I'm really excited to share it after my brief writing hiatus.

This past week, I went to my favorite Korean restaurant Cho Sun Ok. It's quite the ways from downtown (a little north of Wrigleyville) but it's definitely worth making the trek for great galbi, chap chae, and bulgogi. Here's a low-quality picture of the high-quality meal I shared with some friends at Cho Sun Ok this weekend.

In addition to my new post, look out for another look at Airbnb, a great old blog post by Marc Andreesen, and my favorite insight from *Black Swan*. Until next week ✌️

## [**The Unbundling of Business**](https://kevinarifin.com/unbundle){:target='_blank}

In the middle of preparing for my newsletter, I was struck with inspiration to write this [post](https://kevinarifin.com/unbundle){:target='_blank'}, and maybe a follow-up coming in the next few weeks.

In my essay, I discuss how the idea of a business is slowly being broken up into smaller and smaller pieces. This is possible because the internet enables software service companies like Okta or ServiceNow to provide previously internal services via an external vendor.

This "unbundling" of the company is making companies smaller and smaller as they can lean down to solving the specific mission of their company. Most companies will into the category of solving a business problem 10x better than an internal solution or solving a highly specific problem that requires immense domain knowledge.

I call this the bifurcated company distribution. These companies make up the long tail with a select few monoliths that provide diverse ecosystems and have extreme returns to scale like Apple, Amazon, and Microsoft. This bifurcation is only going to increase, but it's actually a good thing because it lowers the barrier for entry to start a business and allows potential loonshots to focus solely on their problem at hand.

## The Real MVP

Continuing on my discussion of Airbnb from last week, let's take a moment to look at Airbnb's MVP (minimal viable product). They've come a long way from a Craigslist-style website to the multi-billion dollar company they are today.

## [**Four Types of Luck**](https://pmarchive.com/luck_and_the_entrepreneur.html){:target='_blank}

I first heard of the idea of four types of luck through a [Naval podcast](https://nav.al/money-luck){:target='_blank'}, but wanted to dig deeper into the source of the idea so I read [Marc Andreesen's post](https://pmarchive.com/luck_and_the_entrepreneur.html){:target='_blank'} on it. Turns out, the idea has origins from Dr. James Austin's book *Chase, Chance, and Creativity* - looks like I'll be adding that to my reading list.

Marc Andreesen argues that understanding the 4 types of luck gives you a formula to make luck on your side. As Harvey Dent would say: "I make my own luck."

These are the 4 types of luck that Marc and Naval draw from Dr. James Austin.

1. Blind luck. Like winning the lottery. You can't influence blind luck and it has nothing to do with you. It just happens.

2. Luck by motion. You experiment and explore with no purpose. You submit random resumes to a bunch of different types of companies, and one happens to match your passion.

3. Luck by skill. You develop enough specific knowledge about the right set of problems. Like having an in-depth understanding of computer vision before machine learning became mainstream.

4. The fourth type of luck is the most complicated. While the third type of luck is focused on skill, the fourth type of luck is focused on the person - luck comes to you because of who you are and how your distinct behaviors. It's being the type of person that intercepts problems at unique angles.

## Quote of the Week

> I don't run for trains. Snub your destiny. I have taught myself to resist running to keep on schedule. This may seem a very small piece of advice, but it registered. In refusing to run to catch trains, I have felt the true value of elegance and aesthetics in behavior, a sense of being in control of my time, my schedule, and my life. Missing a train is only painful if you run after it! Likewise, not matching the idea of success others expect from you is only painful if that’s what you are seeking.

I've been thinking of this quote all week since I read it in Nassim Taleb's *Black Swan*. In a literal sense, it means don't run for the train that's coming as you stroll down the escalator. Don't chase the light that's counting down as you're walking 100 feet away from the crosswalk. Don't chase after societies physical rules.

But this applies in a figurative sense as well. Don't chase after the internships and accolades society rules you should. I'm not saying you shouldn't try hard to achieve them. But don't chase after them the same way everyone else in society is chasing them. Supersede the competition by figuring out your authentic way of reaching your target end state.

Not chasing the light is just practice for the figurative meaning. Create the rules of your own game, and only then will you full control of your life.
