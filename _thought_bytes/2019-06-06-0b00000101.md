Over the weekend, I had a profound realization about something I’m really passionate about but never was able to put into words: using technology as a means of self-improvement. From leveraging Google Sheets to keep a meticulous budget, using Arc App to track my daily movements, and logging my weight, sleep, and exercise data on Apple Health, these are all examples of using technology to better myself and focus my life process on the things that matter.

The name Life in Bytes is inspired by this previously unsaid idea. I wanted to synthesize all the bits of information and data from my life into something meaningful.

Unfortunately, there's no new post this week. Part 2 of Monetizing the Internet will be postponed until next week. I underestimated the amount of research and the difficulty of the topic and I'd rather take another week to sharpen my thoughts rather than rush the piece. I'm excited to share Part 2 with you and looking forward to the discussions that result from the piece.

## The Symposium

After a two week hiatus, Nick and I hosted our second Symposium with our friends Max and Charlie. We host The Symposium to deliberately promote challenging conversation about things we normally we don't talk about. This week's articles focus on social inequality.

**Symposium 2 (June 5, 2019)**
* [The 9.9 Percent Is the New American Aristocracy](https://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/2018/06/the-birth-of-a-new-american-aristocracy/559130/){:target='_blank'}
* [Actually, the 1 Percent Are Still The Problem](https://slate.com/business/2018/05/forget-the-atlantics-9-9-percent-the-1-percent-are-still-the-problem.html){:target='_blank'}

We all agreed that social inequality is a problem that we are not doing enough to solve. Of course Andrew Yang and his Freedom Dividend were brought up, but our discussion focused on education as a solution to social inequality. Improving education starts with paying teachers more but also requires widespread systematic changes that better leverage technology and democratize access to education.

## [**Pursuit of Happiness**](https://justinkan.com/feeling-good-justins-program-b77c70437ee2){:target='_blank'}

Happiness is developing the right balance of habits that keep you healthy and fulfilled. While this balance is different for everyone, it's great to get different perspectives on their recipe for happiness. Successful entrepreneur and venture capitalist [Justin Kan](https://twitter.com/justinkan){:target='_blank'} shared his own [list](https://justinkan.com/feeling-good-justins-program-b77c70437ee2){:target='_blank'} with some great insights.

I really like the part about thinking about the phone as "a toxic, time-wasting Skinner-box in your pocket at all times". No one intends to spend a lot of time on their phone, but the frictionless nature of doing anything on the phone a trap for our attention.

I took Justin's advice to turn my phone black and white and also increase friction for things like browsing the internet or social media and making it easier to use my phone for productive things like podcasts and reading books. So far it's been a successful experiment and allowed me to reallocate my attention to more fulfilling things.

With Apple’s WWDC happening this past Monday, I thought it was appropriate to go back in time and rewatch the [unveiling of the iPhone](https://youtu.be/vN4U5FqrOdQ){:target='_blank'}. Twelve years after the release of the iPhone, its easy to take the device you can do basically everything with for granted.

As I rewatched the presentation, I think it’s important to remember how masterful of a showman Steve Jobs was. All the touch gestures, interface, and functionality that we now use instinctively dazzled the crowd. His deliberate presentation style is now mimicked by speakers today.

It’s an inspiring video and makes you think what innovation in the coming years will be looked back upon as the revolutionary invention of the decade.

## [**Paul Graham: The Age of the Essay**](http://www.paulgraham.com/essay.html){:target='_blank'}

I’ll be starting a weekly section featuring my favorite ideas from an arbitrarily selected Paul Graham essay. For those of you not familiar with Paul Graham, he is famous for founding startup incubator Y Combinator.

This week’s Paul Graham essay is a recommendation from my housemate [Nick](https://nickchua.me){:target='_blank'}: [The Age of the Essay](http://www.paulgraham.com/essay.html){:target='_blank'}. Written in 2004, it is as timeless as ever. Here are some of my favorite quotations from the piece.

***An essay is something you write to try to figure something out.***

Different from essays you write in school where you make an argument and concisely try to prove your point, essays are more of a journey. Pick an idea and build up the reader's intuition as they read your piece. It's a good perspective on writing, as many of us are trained to write in a more academic and argumentative manner.

***Just as inviting people over forces you to clean up your apartment, writing something that other people will read forces you to think well.***

I've spent a lot of time reading, listening to podcasts, and consuming all sorts of content with the intent to learn as much as I can. But since I've started writing in March, I've increased my rate of learning exponentially. Writing has both clarified and focused my thoughts, synthesizing ideas from a variety of sources with my own perspective. It's like cleaning out my brain of thoughts that don't matter and consolidating them into the important bits.

***I found the best way to get information out of [people who just traveled ] was to ask what surprised them. How was the place different from what they expected?***

We all build mental models of what we think the world should be like. When things are unexpected, they break our model and we learn from them. Writing is a powerful tool to discuss an idea that people are familiar with and take them to an unexpected conclusion.

When Stephen Hawking passed away, I saw multiple recommendations for his book [*A Brief History of Time*](https://www.amazon.com/Brief-History-Time-Stephen-Hawking/dp/0553380168){:target='_blank'}. Hawking was known for being great at explaining difficult concepts in an easy to understand manner, and a few chapters in, I am not disappointed. If you're looking for a short, science-focused read, this is a great book to check out.
