A lot of exciting news this week! Starting with this edition, Thought Bytes will be coming to your inbox every Thursday. The hope is to give a sense of consistency to the newsletter and give you a good collection of content for weekend downtime. The purpose behind the newsletter is to share timeless content that gives your brain something to bite on, and there’s no better time for mental growth than the weekend.

I've also changed my URL from [lifeinbyt.es](kevinarifin.com){:target='_blank'} to [kevinarifin.com](kevinarifin.com){:target='_blank'}. I thought it would be easier to remember, but my blog will still be known as Life in Bytes. As always, I would love to discuss any ideas and articles I share on my newsletter and appreciate any feedback to improve my work.

## [**Monetizing the Internet**](https://kevinarifin.com/monetizing-the-internet-1){:target='_blank'}

Everyone likes free stuff. From Facebook to Google to Spotify, a lot of what we use on the internet is free. If you're not paying for the service, the services probably come with ads. There's more than meets the eye when we look behind the business model that poweres the internet. In a three part series called Monetizing the Internet, I will explore how we monetize the internet and how we can create a new business model that benefits both content creators and users. You can find part one [here](https://kevinarifin.com/monetizing-the-internet-1){:target='_blank'}.

## The Symposium

My housemate Nick and I recently started a discussion group that we’re calling The Symposium. We both feel that people don’t have enough intellectually stimulating and challenging conversation on a day to day basis, so it’s important to deliberately create time for it. While I can’t have those conversations in person with all of you, I’ll include the readings for The Symposium in my newsletters as well as some highlights from our conversations.

**Symposium 1 (May 16, 2019)**

* [Elon Musk: The World's Raddest Man](https://waitbutwhy.com/2015/05/elon-musk-the-worlds-raddest-man.html){:target='_blank'}
* [How Tesla Will Change The World](https://waitbutwhy.com/2015/06/how-tesla-will-change-your-life.html){:target='_blank'}

Allen and Jon joined us for our first iteration of The Symposium. We discussed if Tesla is a millennial stock, how the perception of Elon Musk has changed from 2015 to 2019, and what part of Tesla, from software to battery tech to branding, is their competitive advantage. It was a successful first Symposium and we look forward to continuing these in the future.

Agree or disagree, I think it’s important to listen to everyone’s perspective. The Daily is one of my favorite podcasts and I listen to it on my daily walks to work. In this episode, they interview two Trump supporters and get their take on his policies. It’s insightful to see their reasoning about why they support him and how their impressions of his presidency have shifted over time.

Crypto is going crazy again. Some people argue that blockchain is the future; others think it’s a huge scam. Before coming to conclusions, I think it’s essential to understand how it works. This is the best [video](https://youtu.be/bBC-nXj3Ng4){:target='_blank'} I've watched on understanding the blockchain by one of my favorite content creators, 3blue1brown.

We all eat. And we like people that cook. But could cooking become obsolete in the near future? Alex Danco is a new writer that I discovered recently with interesting perspectives on the future. Check out this awesome [piece](https://alexdanco.com/2019/05/09/cooking-as-a-service/){:target='_blank'} about how the future of mobility will transform the food industry.

## [**What I'm Reading**](https://jamesclear.com/atomic-habits){:target='_blank'}

[*James Clear*](https://jamesclear.com/atomic-habits){:target='_blank'}

I highly recommend James Clear's *Atomic Habits*. He discusses the idea of habit stacking, where you pair already existing habits with habits you want to develop. I've been trying to make more time to read, so my new habit stack is working out, then drinking chocolate milk while reading a book. In the next couple weeks, I'll be working on a post series based on several ideas from this book, so look out for that!
