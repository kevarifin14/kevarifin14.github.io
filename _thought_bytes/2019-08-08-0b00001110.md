Another week, another Thought Bytes. Chicago weather has been more like California weather recently and I've gotten the chance to go for runs to the park and spend time outdoors strolling to various coffee shops in the city.

This past weekend Sarah and Cem visited me from the Bay Area. We went to Lolla on Saturday and also stopped by my favorite chicken and waffles place of all time. Roister is a 1-star Michelin restaurant in the Fulton Market District that is known for their dinner, but does an awesome (and much cheaper) brunch as well.

I've been slacking on my reading recently (still working through *Black Swan*), but have been making time for some podcasts. This week's newsletter features a new David Perell interview, an interview with Brian Chesky that has stood the test of time, and what's up next on my reading list.

This is one of the first interviews Reid Hoffman did on his podcast Masters of Scale, and it has withstood the test of time. Brian Chesky shares one of my favorite founding stories in this interview with Reid Hoffman. From manually getting their first set of homes one by one tracked on a spreadsheet to selling cereal boxes to raise money, Airbnb's story is full of the challenges a startup will go through.

Here are my favorite moments in the podcast:
* One of Reid's favorite bits of startup advice comes from this interview: do things that don't scale. Brian and his cofounders flew to New York to individually meet with each host. To get in their homes and get an idea of what their listings were like, they hired free photographers for the hosts. Startups require an extreme level of hustle and creativity to succeed.
* Brian went through the exercise of describing a five-star Airbnb check-in experience. Then a six-star experience, seven-star experience, and so on. Each additional star made the check-in more and more outlandish, like a bottle of your favorite wine waiting for you, reservations to a famous restaurant, or Elon Musk meeting you at the airport to greet you. This exercise of blending the practical and the outlandish helps you find the sweet-spot target experience for your customers. While some of the ideas may be outlandish, it's about building an experience your customers will love and talk about.
* Succeeding as a startup means you are 10x better than the status quo. But these answers don't come from looking in the same industry. Solutions come from looking into orthogonal industries. For Airbnb, this was entertainment: how could they create a travel experience that was scripted like a movie? This idea of looking at orthogonal industries is common among many successful founders and venture capitalists. Inspiration doesn't come from doing the same thing over and over again. It comes from applying a breadth of experiences to a problem you identify.
* The financial struggles of a startup are real. Brian and his cofounder used a baseball card binder to store their credit cards. They were a combined tens of thousands in credit card debt. Every angel investor either didn't reply or passed. To raise money, they designed collectible cereal boxes called "Obama O's" and "Cap'n McCain's" and made $30,000. It's crazy to think how Airbnb went from that point of near bankruptcy to a billion dollar company, but they truly evoked the ethos of startup scrappiness.

## [**Tren Griffin on Learning**](https://www.perell.com/podcast/tren-griffin){:target='_blank'}

David Perell interviews Tren Griffin on his latest episode of the North Star podcast. Tren writes a lot: 1.3 million words on his [blog](https://25iq.com){:target='_blank'} and multiple books. He also reads a lot, citing Richard Zeckhauser, Charlie Munger, and Nassim Taleb as some of the foundation individuals for his ideas. It's amazing to see the body of work he has put together and inspiring for me as I look to build up my own knowledge and writing skills.

Two of my favorite highlights from the podcast:
* Being around smart people makes you smarter. It's a virtuous cycle where you are constantly challenging each other's ideas. It leads to early success and that success compounds, so seek those opportunities early.
* Tren talks about the importance of going to parties. But at these parties, talk to people. And when you're talking, treat them like they're the only person in the world. Don't think about who else to talk to or what else you could be doing. Give them your full attention. This insight is simple yet important, as we live in a world where we're always thinking about what's next.

## What I'm Reading

I haven't finish Nassim Taleb's *Black Swan* yet, but next up on my queue is [*An Elegant Puzzle* by Will Larson](https://www.amazon.com/Elegant-Puzzle-Systems-Engineering-Management/dp/1732265186/ref=sr_1_1?crid=3SIQA22AN5IUO&keywords=elegant+puzzle&qid=1565327760&s=gateway&sprefix=elegant+puzzle%2Caps%2C139&sr=8-1){:target='_blank'}. It's a book on engineering management (yes, sounds dry), but as someone who hopes to be in a leadership role in technology in the future, it sounds like an interesting read.

It's written by a guy from Stripe (Will Larson) and published by Stripe Press. Stripe cultivates a culture of long form writing and has many prominent bloggers popular on Twitter, and it's awesome they also publish books as well. Look for a takeaways post about the book in the near future.
