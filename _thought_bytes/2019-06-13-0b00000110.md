I'm adding the final touches to the newsletter as I fly to California to attend my brother's graduation at UCLA. Plane rides are a nice purgatory to disconnect and just work on the things without distraction.

There's a lot of content in this week's newsletter - two new posts on *Life in Bytes*, my thoughts on another Paul Graham essay, and another great book to read.

Thank you for subscribing to Thought Bytes, and if there's anything that can make this newsletter more personally valuable, I'd love to hear from you.

## [**Monetizing the Internet (Part 2)**](https://kevinarifin.com/monetizing-the-internet-2){:target='_blank'}

Three weeks in the making, [Monetizing the Internet (Part 2)](https://kevinarifin.com/monetizing-the-internet-2){:target='_blank'} is finally published. It was the most difficult piece I've written, but I'm happy with the way it turned out and look forward to the discussions that result from the essay.

Part 2 covers my ideas for a new business model for the internet. The backbone of this business model is the phone or laptop you using to read this newsletter. With over 5 billion devices in the world, leveraging this compute power would change the way we monetize the internet. If you're interested in learning more about this model, you can read more [here](https://kevinarifin.com/monetizing-the-internet-2){:target='_blank'}!

[The Joe Rogan Experience](http://podcasts.joerogan.net/podcasts/naval-ravikant){:target='_blank'}

You know you’ve listened to a great podcast if you’re still thinking about it days later. This podcast with Joe Rogan and Naval is one of the most interesting conversations I’ve ever listened to. I immediately gave it a second listen and noted my favorite thoughts Naval shared.

Here is a selection of the favorites from my favorites with my perspective on his thoughts - there were too many to include all in just one email. I’ve included timestamps for each quotation if you’d like to listen and get more context. You can find the full list [here](https://kevinarifin.com/naval){:target='_blank'}.

***[33:00]*** **High-quality work will be available in a gig fashion. You wake up in the morning, your phone will buzz, and you’ll have five different jobs from people who’ve worked with you in the past or referred you... You decide whether to take the contract or not, the contract is right there on the spot, you get paid a certain amount, you get rated every day or every week, you get the money delivered. And then when you’re done working you turn it off and go to Tahiti or wherever you want.**

If you ask ride-share drivers why they like their job, a common answer is they like being their own boss and making their own hours. Imagine this for high-paying, creative jobs like software engineering, writing, and music making. It already exists in the film industry where actors and actresses agree to contract for different films.

Contract work is a result of the personal brand you've developed through the quality of your work and the relationships you've fostered. We'll see that this is a recurring theme in a lot of Naval's thoughts: growing the value of your personal equity and having the freedom to do what you want, where you want, when you want.

***[45:30]*** **Creativity is the last frontier. Automation over a long enough period of time will replace every non-creative work. But that’s great news. That means all of our basic needs are taken care of and what remains for us is to be creative, which is really what every human wants.**

There's a lot of fear that automation will leave lots of people without jobs to do. But I don't think it's something we should be afraid of. Easily automated jobs like truck driving or warehouse work are tough jobs. Freeing up human capacity from this type of work will allow us to focus on things that truly make us fulfilled.

When we think about what makes us fulfilled, it's usually something that is more creative work. The introductory computer science course at Berkeley inspires a lot of students to switch to majoring in Computer Science because it's probably the first course they've taken in their life where they can create something and immediately get feedback about their creation.

It's the same with careers and life. Whether it's consuming other people's creations by watching Netflix or reading a book or creating your own content, like making music or writing, these are the things that make people happiest. If we can redirect more and more of our societal attention to these things, I think the world will be a better place.

***[1:55:50]*** **Retirement is when you stop sacrificing today for some imaginary tomorrow. When today is complete in and of itself.**

These words really spoke to me. Growing up in the Bay Area with high academic pressure from parents and peers, it always feels like today is never enough and you're always working towards the goals of tomorrow.

Even after graduating from school and finding a job, there always is a better tomorrow that you feel like you need to sacrifice today for. It's a hard cycle to get out of, but when these feelings are particularly strong, I take a moment to think of the things in the moment that I am grateful for.

***[2:17:00]*** **I’m always working. But it looks like work to them but it feels like play to me. And that’s how know no one can compete with me on it. Because I’m just playing 16 hours a day. And if they want to compete with me and they’re going to work, they’re going to lose because they’re not going to do it 16 hours a day 7 days a week.**

Through all my readings, there are several overarching trends of successful individuals that I admire. One of the common trends: feeling like work isn't work. It's about finding something that's authentically you and running with it.

To some, it may appear that starting a personal blog or working on projects outside of work is just doing more work. But to me it's not work; it's a continuous process of finding things that I am naturally curious about and inspire me to create something tangible.

It's not an easy thing to find, and I struggle with this often. But this continuous journey to find work that's not work, that's so authentically you that no one can compete with you, is one of the great challenges of life.

## [**This Week in Paul Graham**](http://www.paulgraham.com/mean.html){:target='_blank'}

This week's Paul Graham essay is [*Mean People Fail*](http://paulgraham.com/mean.html){:target='_blank}. The premise is simple: success favors those who use their intellect. Being mean and belligerent is a primitive human instinct. It clouds our best judgment and makes us stupid. I like to think about it in the context of civilization: war becomes increasingly more costly as society becomes more developed. As businesses and industries mature, meanness is increasingly destructive. Here's my favorite line from the essay:

**When you think of successful people from history who weren't ruthless, you get mathematicians and writers and artists. The exciting thing is that their m.o. seems to be spreading. The games played by intellectuals are leaking into the real world, and this is reversing the historical polarity of the relationship between meanness and success.**

I've started reading *Hard Things About Hard Things*, a recommendation from [Nick](https://nickchua.me){:target='_blank'}. Ben Horowitz, well-known for his work with Marc Andreeson at a16z,

A lot of people dream of being a tech CEO, running your own business, wealthy beyond imagination, and well-respected by society. But the hard things about running a business are rarely talked about. Sometimes you have to personally fire employees passionate about your vision. Other times you hear your wife is about to die as you are pitching your company to investors. You face the depths of depression and every decision you make decides the life and death of your company.

These are all elements of stories from Horowitz's journey. It's an excellent read to see the world from the perspective of one of the most well-respepcted venture capitalists and to realize how important it is to be mentally prepared to run a business.
