As I enjoy summer in Chicago, I thought it would be fun to share some of my favorite places in the city. This past week I ate at [Grand Palace](https://www.yelp.com/biz/grand-palace-chicago?osq=grand+palace){:target='_blank'} for the fourth time in 2 months. It's a little outside of Chinatown, but it's worth the trek as it's the best Chinese food in Chicago (in my opinion).

It's super authentic and the staff doesn't speak English too well so I always order through pictures. Here's my order from this past Friday's meal.

Hope you're enjoying the long summer days, wherever you are in the world. Until next week ✌️

## [**Lessons from a Year of Work**](https://kevinarifin.com/lessons-2019){:target='_blank'}

![](https://kevinarifin.com/images/berkeley-sunset.jpg){:class='img-responsive img-container-center'}

It's crazy how fast time goes by. My intern buddy at work [Joey](http://joeyhejna.com){:target='_blank'} said something quite insightful the other day: "Life moves exponentially as you get older so once you've turned 20 your life is half over." I've found that to be particularly true as I've grown up, which makes it ever more important to take moments to slow down life and learn from your experiences.

This year has been full of personal growth and I compiled my 4 big takeaways in this [post](https://kevinarifin.com/lessons-2019){:target='_blank'}. There is some recency bias in that this is mainly a collection of what I’ve been thinking about recently, but I think they are valuable nevertheless.

* **Take care of your life stuff.**

    Finding a place to live, insurance, finances, and health are the foundation of life after college. If you don't take care of these things you won't have the freedom to do the things that you want in your free time.

* **Do things that leverage and compound yourself.**

    There's a finite amount of time in each day, and those who separate themselves are those who can leverage and compound themselves in those hours. Leverage is learning skills that allow you to multiply your impact, like learning to code or writing online. Compounding yourself is developing skills that reap dividends in the future, like reading and writing, learning new skills, and having deep conversations with others. Be patient with the results, but it's important to develop the right process to make your desired outcomes likely.

* **Surround yourself with people you aspire to be like, both online and in reality.**

    Your aspirations are defined by the things in your sphere of consciousness. Learn as much as you can from the people around you, but also leverage the internet to connect you with people you aspire to be like. These people you aspire to be like will challenge you to think and do things differently. Twitter has been immensely valuable to expose myself to ideas and individuals that I never would've had the chance to interact with.

* **Savor your 20s.**

    Being in your early 20s is an undervalued asset in society. There's no better time to take risks than in your early 20s. People are invested in your growth, you can ask whatever dumb questions you want, and you can talk about and work on crazy ideas that older people think are impossible. I don't think I'm taking enough advantage of this, and I can't wait to challenge myself to take more risks this next year.

## [**Neuralink's Big Announcements**](https://neuralink.com){:target='_blank'}

I've been following Neuralink's development since I read [Wait But Why's post](https://waitbutwhy.com/2017/04/neuralink.html){:target='_blank'} on the venture 2 years ago. For those unfamiliar, Neuralink is an Elon Musk company trying to develop a device that allows our brains to control machines, or a brain-machine interface (BMI) as they refer to it.

This past Tuesday, Neuralink hosted their first public event where they announced their recent progress. In typical Elon Musk fashion, the event started 40 minutes late, but was full of some pretty mind-blowing stuff. Here are some highlights:

* They're ready to start testing brain surgeries. It's way less invasive than current methods which involve shaving a whole side of your head and leave a huge scar. Neuralink's surgery would involve drilling a small, nail-sized hole in the skull and planting four nodes that are less than the width of a strand of hair. The first tests will be on mentally-challenged individuals with the hope that Neuralink's technology can enhance their mental capacity.
* The nodes record the firing of a collection of neurons to determine intention. Decoding this neural code is a huge challenge. They're trying to interpret thoughts and use that to control avatars. For example, imagine a paralyzed person who can think of walking and now control an avatar in video game.
* There are huge latency problems. All calculations have to happen in less than a split second so the latency is not interpretable by the human mind. Neuralink is designing special chips to handle the processing of neural data that communicates with a small hearing-aid looking device that goes behind the ear called the Pod, which is controlled through an iPhone app.
* My favorite line from the show: "A monkey has been able to control a computer with his brain." Unreal. I'm unbelievably excited to see what the future holds for Neuralink.

## [**Stratechery**](https://stratechery.com){:target='_blank'}
![](https://kevinarifin.com/images/stratechery.png){:class='img-responsive img-container-center'}

For the last couple months, I've been a big fan of [Stratechery](https://stratechery.com){:target='_blank'}, a blog on tech strategy and analysis. I savored his free weekly articles and occasional podcasts. He's most famous for [Aggregation Theory](https://stratechery.com/2015/aggregation-theory/){:target='_blank'}, the idea that the internet aggregates demand in a way that was impossible before with zero marginal cost, giving immense leverage to these companies.

I cannot recommend Ben Thompson and his essays on Stratechery enough. For anyone working in tech, his publications are a must-read, and provide a powerful lens to analyze the industry.

I recently became a [paid subscriber](https://stratechery.com/membership/){:target='_blank'} to access his Daily Updates (three additional articles a week) and access to his full archive of work. For $100 a year, you get the highest quality tech analysis. That's cheaper than Netflix, and you get the added bonus of brain growth. I don't get anything for recommending Stratechery, so this is solely out of how highly I think of his work.

## What I'm Reading

A recommendation from my brother Andrew and his girlfriend Vivian (both subscribers of the newsletter!), [*When Breath Becomes Air*](https://www.amazon.com/When-Breath-Becomes-Paul-Kalanithi/dp/081298840X){:target='_blank'} is a book written by late neurosurgeon Paul Kalanithi. He was diagnosed with stage IV lung cancer at the age of 36 just as he was about to complete his neurosurgeon training.

I've heard great things about the book and I'm sure this will shape my life perspective in a positive way.
