One day late, but one new article in exchange. I haven't written a new piece in over a month and I'm excited to share this article on my idea for a digital fitness marketplace. You can find the article inline at the end of the newsletter, or if you prefer to read in the browser, you can find it [here](https://kevinarifin.com){:target='_blank'}.

My recent experiences doing spin classes on Peloton and yoga sessions on Glo inspired the post on a digital fitness marketplace. I believe a marketplace to facilitate one-on-one connections between trainers and athletes would be the last mover in the digital fitness space.

If you have any thoughts on the post and the idea of a digital fitness marketplace, I would love to hear them. In addition to the new post, I share another quote from Bo Eason's book as well as one of the most insightful podcasts I've listened to recently. See you next week ✌️

It's been awhile since a new Your Undivided Attention podcast, but this new episode was worth the wait. On the episode, Johann Hari is interviewed and discusses his thoughts on addiction and technology.

The key line of the show is **"The opposite of addiction is not sobriety. The opposite of addiction is connection."**

What Hari means by this is overcoming addiction, whether it's to drugs or technology, is not stopping the usage of the substance, but connecting with others on a meaningful level.

He turns to a well-known study where rats were given two options for water, one laced with cocaine and the other normal water. The rats would choose the laced water source and end up overdosing.

The conclusion seems obvious. Drug addiction is a purely chemical reaction. However an alternative study provides the same options to rats, but the rats live in a rat heaven - lots of spinny wheels to run on, other rats to congregate with, and plenty of food. The rats showed no preference for the laced water, and none died of overdosing.

The true conclusion is addiction is a result of lack of connection. In the case of technology, technology usage is causing the lack of connection. And it's not just any connection - it's meaningful connection.

Think about how much technology has changed how we interact with the world around us. Phones allow us to make decisions completely independently of the physical world around us - from getting directions, asking for a ride, or choosing a restaurant.

Instead, we can fully curate our environment both in reality and in the digital world to be composed of people that look like us, think like us, and act like us. But the interactions with people that are different are what actually teach us things.

The superpower of humans is banding together. A human all alone back in the day be depressed and anxious for a real reason. We've actively disband ourselves from a tribe, and it's the root of many of the mental health problems our society faces.

This is an insightful way of thinking about technology and its effects on our personal lives. Listen to the full podcast below:

## [**Digital Fitness On Demand**](https://kevinarifin.com/digital-fitness){:target='_blank'}

![](https://kevinarifin.com/images/nycentral.jpeg){:class='img-responive img-container-center'}

Imagine a world where streaming services were fragmented by genre. You could only find animated children's movies on Disney+, Netflix had all the horror movies, HBO was the king of comedy, and so on. But no one watches just one genre of movie - you’d have to juggle multiple subscription services. Coincidentally enough, this is kind of what's happening as everyone gets into the streaming video on demand game, but at least a Netflix subscription can satisfy most of your digital entertainment needs.

This thought experiment describes the current state of digital fitness. Each company offers a specific “genre” of exercise - [Peloton](https://www.onepeloton.com){:target='_blank'} for spin classes, [Glo](https://www.glo.com){:target='_blank'} and [Gaia](https://www.gaia.com/yoga/practices){:target='_blank'} specializing in yoga, [Tonal](https://www.tonal.com){:target='_blank'} with cable-based strength workouts, and independent trainers offering workout videos and programs for their own niche.

Fitness isn't a result of just doing one kind of workout. A common complaint about working out is how boring doing the same types of exercises is week after week. Not only is doing a different type of exercise more fun, studies have shown that cross-training (doing different types of exercise) reduces the chances of injury.

Another aspect of digital fitness is having access to a large library of trainers. Every individual can find the best trainer for them for any type of exercise. After trying out several instructors for Glo, I found an instructor I liked and have only done yoga classes with him. When watching workout videos online, I generally stick with athletes I trust like [Kevin D Lo](https://www.instagram.com/kevindlo/?hl=en){:target='_blank'} and [ThenX](https://www.thenx.com){:target='_blank'}. Personal training is personal because each individual has a different set of fitness goals, so individuals gravitate towards the trainers they trust to help them achieve their respective goals.

With these insights into the digital fitness space, these are the problems with the existing ecosystem:

1. Too specific on the type of exercise.
2. Too broad on the selection of teachers.

### The Marketplace for Digital Fitness

Enter a marketplace for digital fitness. Instead of a subscription to a company like Peloton or Tonal, you can subscribe to individual coaches. Think the [Substack](https://substack.com){:target='_blank'} of digital fitness. (For those unfamiliar with Substack, they provide a platform for writers to create blogs and newsletters and monetize them through subscriptions.)

One side of the digital fitness marketplace is the people creating digital fitness content. Let's call them trainers. The other side of the marketplace is individuals interested in working out. Let's call them athletes. This is how I envision the marketplace for digital fitness:

1. Any trainer can upload self-created fitness content. Examples include training videos such as a spin class or a weightlifting workout, books and workout guides, and motivational videos. They set a monthly subscription price to access their content.
2. Athletes can subscribe to set of trainers that help them reach their personal fitness goals. They pay a monthly subscription fee for access to each trainer's content.
3. The platform provides services that make it easy to become a successful digital trainer. From assisting with content creation to helping with customer discovery, the marketplace lowers the barrier for entry to become a digital trainer. From an athlete perspective, the platform can leverage usage patterns to recommend and personalize a set of trainers to subscribe to.

This marketplace solves the two problems of the digital fitness marketplace today. Athletes can diversify their workouts by subscribing to the set of trainers across many different types of exercise. In my personal case, I'd have access to the best weightlifting, calisthenics, spin, and yoga trainer that fits my tastes.

A marketplace would attract the best trainers because their upside is unlimited compared to coaching exclusively for a company like Peloton.

Peloton's excellent spin instructors drive a lot of the recurring subscription profit, which amounted to $77.4 million for the fiscal year ending in June 2019. The average Peloton instructor makes about $300,000 and there are about 30 instructors, which means Peloton instructors shared in just about 12% of the subscription profits.

While Peloton definitely deserves to reap much of those profits by aggregating the demand of spin class enthusiasts, some of the best spin instructors could drive high subscriptions by themselves. Assuming that the marketplace takes a cut similar to marketplaces like Airbnb and Uber, a marketplace would allow trainers on the platform to capture 80% to 90% of the subscription revenue.

The best trainers would bring along their loyal following to the platform, who can now subscribe at a lower rate since they are just paying for the trainer they love. As the athlete base on the platform increases, the marketplace becomes an aggregator of digital fitness demand.

This makes monetizing a passion for fitness possible for everyone. Just as Substack allows anyone to monetize a newsletter, this marketplace allows anyone to monetize their fitness passion. ThenX can upload their workouts to the marketplace instead of building out their on app, which is missing the network effects of the marketplace. Someone who recently underwent a body transformation and lost a lot of weight can share their workouts and exercises to the niche of people interested in weight loss and body transformation.

The marketplace for digital fitness is also a highly scalable and protiable business as well. Let's evaluate a digital fitness marketplace as a tech company using the criteria from [Stratechery's Ben Thompson](https://stratechery.com/2019/what-is-a-tech-company/){:target='_blank'}.

* **Software creates ecosystems:** A software marketplace creates an ecosystem of athletes and trainers.

* **Software has zero marginal costs:** The marketplace is like Peloton without the bikes. The services the marketplace provides are a zero marginal cost offering.

* **Software improves over time:** The platform constantly improves. For trainers, the platform can continue improving its offering of tools for content creation and distribution which lowers the barrier for entry to become a digital trainer. For both trainers and individuals who work out, the more data the platform has, the better the platform can connect trainers and individuals.

* **Software offers infinite leverage:** Any trainer can now reach the entire world, and every individual working out can find the right trainer to achieve their fitness goals, no matter what type of exercise.

* **Software enables zero transaction costs:** Trainers and individuals can make frictionless one-on-one transactions using the marketplace.

The marketplace for digital fitness checks all five boxes for being a tech company. The last mover in the digital fitness space is going to be the marketplace that aggregates the supply of digital fitness. The best trainers are going to be on this platform because it gives them superior distribution and direct connection with athletes everywhere. Athletes want to train with the best trainers for them, and everyone has their own fitness goals. The marketplace leverages the internet to find the trainer just for you, whenever you want, wherever you want.
