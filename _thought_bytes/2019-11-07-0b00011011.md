Awhile back, I listened to an interview between Ezra Klein and Cal Newport, best known for his book [*Deep Work*](https://www.amazon.com/Deep-Work-Focused-Success-Distracted/dp/1455586692){:target='_blank'}. I don’t remember much from the interview, but one point I've been thinking about recently still stands out to me: in today’s world, rarely do we spend time truly alone.

Every moment we are being programmed or doing the programming: consuming podcasts, music, or videos, texting friends and seeing their updates on social media, or spending time with friends in person.

I’ve made it a point to make time for these moments of being truly alone. I find my walks home from work to be the best moment to let my own thoughts flow: a combination of worries, aspirations, and ideas that I’ll later revisit.

The best newsletters I’ve written are weeks where I carve out time to just deliberately think. In a world that’s constantly bombarding you with opinions, it’s ever more important to sift through the noise to find what matters to you. On to my sifted thoughts for the week!

## [**Steve Kerr: The Man Behind Stephen Curry**](https://twitter.com/david_perell/status/1005862520987570176){:target='_blank'}

I'm bummed that Stephen Curry is out for a few months because of a broken left hand. NBA careers are short and the greatest shooter of all time missing significant time in his prime is unfortunate for the game.

On the topic of Stephen Curry, behind Steph's greatness is Steve Kerr. I bumped into this [great tweet](https://twitter.com/david_perell/status/1005862520987570176){:target='_blank'} David Perell had of Steve Kerr coaching Stephen Curry.

The first two pieces of coaching are especially powerful, in both a situation where Steph is not doing great, but also a situation where Steph is killing it:

* That's your shooting totals. That's your plus-minus. Alright, so it's not always tied together. You're doing great stuff out there. The tempo is so different when you're out there. Everything you generate is so positive. It shows up here, not always there; you're doing great. Carry on, my son.

* I would love to feel whatever the hell you're feeling right now. Just once in my life. For me, if I went 5-for-6 and made 4 threes, that was about the best I ever did.

I highly recommend watching the [1 minute clip](https://twitter.com/david_perell/status/1005862520987570176){:target='_blank'} yourself. Steve Kerr is a masterful coach, mentor, and leader.

## [**What is Computer Science**](https://www.netmeister.org/blog/cs-falsehoods.html){:target='_blank'}

My friend Ryan and I had a conversation recently about how little we feel like we learned studying computer science for our undergraduate degree. This reminded me of a (somewhat satirical) list of [computer science falsehoods](https://www.netmeister.org/blog/cs-falsehoods.html){:target='_blank'} that I ran into this week.

Some of my personal favorites that stuck with me:

* Programming == Computer Science.

* Sprinkling printf statements is an efficient debugging technique.

* If it builds on your laptop, it will build on everybody else's.

* You can read the entire file into memory.

* Using lambda in Python is a good idea because it shows others you have a CS degree and understand the "Lambda Calculus".

* Programmers spend most of their time programming.

You can find the rest of the list [here](https://www.netmeister.org/blog/cs-falsehoods.html){:target='_blank'}.

The list reinforced my belief that computer science as a foundation to learning how to coding is the best secondary skill as a builder (while writing is the best secondary skill as a seller). I define builder as someone who creates products, apps, art, or anything tangible other people interact with and sellers as people who take something that was built and find people to consume it.

Computer science is just a foundation for problem solving and building. Pair that with domain knowledge in any field, and you can build anything.

## What I'm Reading

If you've subscribed to Thought Bytes for awhile, you may remember my attempt to develop a daily meditation habit. Well, that somewhat failed though I've recently picked it back up and have done a one minute meditation 9 out of the last 10 days.

As I was perusing through [Bill Gates's reading list](https://www.gatesnotes.com/Books){:target='_blank'}, his review of [*The Headspace Guide to Meditation & Mindfulness*](https://www.amazon.com/Headspace-Guide-Meditation-Mindfulness-Minutes/dp/1250104904){:target='_blank'} by Headspace cofounder Andy Puddicombe caught my eye.

I was skeptical about the book at first, thinking it would just be a 200-page advertisement about Headspace, but Andy Puddicombe’s book draws more on his personal experience and how his founding of Headspace is an embodiment of these experiences.

There's a snippet from the introduction that summarizes why I want to develop a meditation habit:
> Often in life we get so caught up in the analysis, the dissection of every possible outcome, that we miss an opportunity altogether. Of course, some things require careful consideration, but the more we live mindfully, in the moment, the more we start to get a sense of what feels right. Whether you think of it as a gut feeling, intuition, being guided, or just knowing for yourself that it’s the right thing to do, this can be an incredibly liberating discovery.
