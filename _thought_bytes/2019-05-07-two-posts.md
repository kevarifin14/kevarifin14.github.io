Hey everyone,

It's been a couple weeks since my last newsletter. A lot has happened since then. I made a short [post](https://lifeinbyt.es/data-driven-motivation){:target='_blank'} on how data has helped me improve my health. Anyone who knows me personally knows that health and fitness are a huge part of my life, and this post is a slice of how I keep up with my health goals. I've also done a lot of reading and wrote way more than I intended about *Loonshots* and *How the Internet Happened*. Read about my key takeways [here](https://lifeinbyt.es/books-i-like-made-possible-by-the-internet){:target='_blank'}!

Thanks for supporting my work. As a new writer, any feedback and dialogue on my work is helpful for my personal growth. If you enjoy my posts and newsletters, you can help me out by forwarding this newsletter to your friends or encouraging them to [subscribe](https://lifeinbyt.es/subscribe){:target='_blank'}!

Until next time,

Kevin

## [Truck Drivers and the Future of Automation](https://www.nytimes.com/2017/05/22/us/trucking-jobs.html){:target='_blank'}

In my article a couple weeks ago on Andrew Yang, I briefly touched on automation and its affect on truck drivers, but didn’t dive too deep in that aspect of UBI. One of the most important ways to address any issue is humanizing the problem, and this [NY Times article](https://www.nytimes.com/2017/05/22/us/trucking-jobs.html){:target='_blank'} does a great job of highlighting the lives of truck drivers. Trucking is a tough job. No kid dreams of being a truck driver or Amazon warehouse worker when they grow up. But these are the most common jobs in many states. Automation will help us move away from jobs that really are made for machines, and instead allocate energy on things we truly enjoy.

## [What the Hell is Going On?](https://www.perell.com/blog/what-the-hell-is-going-on){:target='_blank'}
I finally finished David Perell's insightful [article](https://www.perell.com/blog/what-the-hell-is-going-on){:target='_blank'} on the state of today’s world. The internet has changed society from a state of information scarcity to information abundance, and that has changed everything, from commerce, education, and politics. This has been a common theme of a lot of my recent readings from *How the Internet Happened* to my dicussions about UBI and Andrew Yang. These changes are inevitable, and we can either be resistant to the opportunities or adapt our systems to keep pace with our ever-changing world.

## [Moneyball Jeopardy](https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/the-man-who-solved-jeopardy/){:target='_blank'}

It’s interesting to see how math has changed games we’ve known for years. Basketball has been forever changed by the 3 pointer, with the Houston Rockets being the primary pioneer in changing the game to focus on efficient shots. Another game that has been changed by math? [Jeopardy](https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/the-man-who-solved-jeopardy/){:target='_blank'}. James Holzhauer has won more than 1.6 million dollars in 22 consecutive victories, with an unorthodox strategy of targeting high value answers to increase the expected values of double jeopardies.
