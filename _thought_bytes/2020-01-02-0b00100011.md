Happy New Year! I'm sending this a day late so I had time to finish my [2019 Year in Review](https://kevinarifin.com/2019-year-in-review){:target='_blank'}.

I found this quote on Reddit the other day and found it inspiring as I start the new year.

Cheers to a 2020 of doing things that spark a light in each of us ðŸ’¥

This is the first year I'm publicly [sharing my reflections for the past year](https://kevinarifin.com/2019-year-in-review){:target='_blank'}. 2019 was a year defined by finding my love for learning again. Sharing this blog and newsletter catalyzed a lot of personal and intellectual growth, connected me with a lot of people online and offline, and helped me clarify my own thoughts and opinions.

**By the numbers:**

* Finished 27 books, up from 13 in 2018.
* Sent 34 newsletters and wrote 20 posts.
* Increased my asleep time by 40 minutes and developed a more consistent sleep schedule.
* Only gained 0.74% body fat and 2.78 pounds.

**My goals for 2020:**

* Publish my reading notes
* Grow my newsletter
* Continue my meditation practice

**2019 Favorites:**
