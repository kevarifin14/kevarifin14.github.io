Greetings from Chicago! After a month of coast-to-coast travel, I'm back in the middle of the country and working my way into a healthy routine again.

With my 22nd newsletter, I've been reflecting a lot on the value of doing a newsletter each week. This [tweet](https://twitter.com/hamishmckenzie/status/1179461225341546498?s=12){:target='_blank'} sums up my thoughts well:

I'm quite reserved in person and am rarely active on social media, but my newsletter as a form of personal media is a way for me to connect with you and my other readers on a level different than reality or social media.

Personal media has also helped me to learn from my friends and random people online as well. Shout out to [Darien](https://darienpayton.com){:target='_blank'}, [Nick](https://nickchua.me/newsletter){:target='_blank'}, [David Perell](https://www.perell.com/newsletter){:target='_blank'}, and [James Clear](https://jamesclear.com/newsletter){:target='_blank'}.

On to my own newsletter.

## Two Ideas

Some interesting thoughts challenging the status quo from two podcasts this week:

1. **How the economic game is changing**

    [An interview with David Perell and Adam Robinson](https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/north-star-podcast/id1170914572?i=1000448408422){:target='_blank'} discussed how the economic game is changing. Growth defined the world economy from the 1940s until now, driven by developing countries and increasing consumption in developed countries. The lever for growth was taking out debt to buy more than your parents: a house instead of an apartment, a Mercedes instead of a Civic, and a PhD instead of a bachelors.

    But now, the two drivers of growth are reversing. Growth in developing countries is stagnating as we reach a natural asymptote. Developed countries are consuming less and sharing more. They don't want to take out a mortgage for a home, buy a nice car, or get a PhD. They want to travel and buy experiences, and the sharing economy is making it easier than ever to own nothing.

    But the establishment doesn't realize this and continues to take on debt at increasingly lower interest rates, on the presumption that growth will continue. And the generation that will have to answer to these debts? The youngest generation, interested in shared experiences and saving money. This has Adam Robinson worried. What are your thoughts?

2. **has-a vs. is-a**

    [Eric Weinstein and Andrew Yang (more on him later) talk](https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/the-portal/id1469999563?i=1000452045633){:target='_blank'} about identity using the "has-a" and "is-a" analogy from object-oriented programming. For example, a car with a radio technically "is-a radio" but it makes more sense to think of the car as "has-a radio".

    This has-a vs. is-a relationship defines America today:
    - People's careers entirely define their identities. "Kevin is-a software engineer" or "He is-a truck driver" are common ways to introduce oneself.
    - However, with automation of jobs and the changing concept of job, we need to decouple a job from our identity and redefine our identities from a "has-a" perspective. Not only is the statement "Kevin has-a job as a software engineer" true, but "Kevin has-a weekly newsletter" and "Kevin has-a family" are equally true parts of my identity.
    - The question I now pose to you: **How do you define your identity outside of your job?**

## [Wealth Taxes and Incentives](https://www.nytimes.com/2019/09/27/business/yang-warren-taxes-mankiw.html?smtyp=cur&smid=tw-nytimesbusiness){:target='_blank'}

When implementing any policy, understanding the incentives is just as important as addressing a problem, no matter how good the intentions are. Income and wealth inequality has been getting a lot of attention and two presidential candidates, Elizabeth Warren and Andrew Yang, have provided contrasting solutions to the issue.

**Warren’s Proposal**: Every year, households would be taxed 2 percent on wealth exceeding $50 million or 3 percent on wealth exceeding $1 billion. 

Incentives:
* Married couples should divorce. This increases your wealth tax exemption from $50 million to $100 million.
* After divorcing, they should gift wealth to adult children. A divorced couple with three adult kids could have a $250 million exemption.

**Yang’s Proposal**: He proposes implementing a value-added tax (VAT), which is essentially a sales tax on every transaction, including ones made by big companies like Amazon and Google. 

I believe the incentives are most clearly outlined in this hypothetical situation:
> Consider two hypothetical CEOs, each earning $10 million a year. Spendthrift Sam spends all his money living the high life. He drinks expensive wine, drives Ferraris and flies a private jet to extravagant vacations. Frugal Frank lives modestly, saving most of his earnings and accumulating a large nest egg. He plans to leave some of it to his children and grandchildren and the rest to charity. Ask yourself: Who should pay higher taxes?

A VAT would hit Spendthrift Sam harder, as every transaction he makes gets hit with the VAT. Frugal Frank wouldn't pay as much in VAT taxes since he's busy saving his money. This seems like the behavior we should reward.

Speaking of Andrew Yang, he just raised $10 million dollars in Q3 (Kamala Harris raised $11.6 million for perspective). Looks like he's here to stay.

I’ve been wanting to watch the movie version of [*Ready Player One*](https://www.amazon.com/Ready-Player-One-Ernest-Cline/dp/0307887448/ref=sxin_1_osp86-1a858a7e_cov?ascsubtag=1a858a7e-6af9-41d6-a093-396026752b64&creativeASIN=0307887448&cv_ct_id=amzn1.osp.1a858a7e-6af9-41d6-a093-396026752b64&cv_ct_pg=search&cv_ct_wn=osp-search&keywords=ready+player+one+book&linkCode=oas&pd_rd_i=0307887448&pd_rd_r=8fa69d22-6626-4ae1-a273-96db0226ccc9&pd_rd_w=VH3Qk&pd_rd_wg=EAW7A&pf_rd_p=a23a388c-add5-49df-b293-a31ade89c6bf&pf_rd_r=GY94SGFV5BF5PQ1VM18G&qid=1570151096&tag=chicagotribune-tca-20){:target='_blank'} but never got around to it. My friend Can recommend the book version to me saying that it was way better than the movie version, so I borrowed a copy and started reading on my flight home to Chicago.

I got hooked. I finished the book in less than three days and could barely focus on anything else. After reading a lot of nonfiction, a science fiction book was a nice change of pace. An interesting thought I had while reading - I found science fiction books (especially when it’s not part of a series) harder to get into than nonfiction books because I had to familiarize myself with the characters and setting, but once I was hooked, I couldn't put the book down.

With nonfiction I usually know most of the premise coming in and I just start reading and know what’s going on. But I’ve never felt like I couldn’t put a nonfiction book down - usually the opposite. There’s just too little variance in the content.

Back to *Ready Player One*, the book poses interesting questions about the relationship between the digital and physical world. What’s wrong with putting everyone in a simulation that has unlimited resources and can simulate not just the most fantastical things on Earth, but the most fantastical things in your favorite universes like *Star Wars* and *Lord of the Rings*?
