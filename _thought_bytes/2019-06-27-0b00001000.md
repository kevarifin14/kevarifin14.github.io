Happy second night of the Democratic Debates. Unfortunately Andrew Yang didn't get much screen time, but the words he shared with the American people concisely addressed the issues of today.

I wrote a [piece](https://kevinarifin.com/why-im-voting-for-andrew-yang){:target='_blank'} awhile back on Andrew Yang and his Freedom Dividend if you've just heard about him.

Enough about politics. There's a lot to talk about this week. I got to see Coach K in person  and finally finished my takeaways from *Guns, Germs, and Steel*. I'm behind on writing my takeaways from the books I've read recently, but I've found it's a great way to reflect and internalize the things I've learned. Hope you enjoy this week's *Thought Bytes* and if there's any way I can improve these weekly emails, I would love to hear from you.

## Wise Words from Coach K

![](https://kevinarifin.com/images/thought_bytes/coachk.jpg){:class='img-responsive img-container-center'}

This week, I had the opportunity to listen to Coach Mike Krzyzewski speak. For those of you not familiar, Coach K is the head coach of Duke University's basketball team and is one of the most successful college basketball coaches in NCAA history, having won five NCAA championships in his forty year tenure and seven top-three NBA draft picks in the last six years.

It was crazy listening to someone who can send a text to Lebron James and immediately get a reply back. He commands so much respect from the most talented players in the game and imparts wisdom in a calm and humorous manner.

His insights in character and leadership were the most interesting, especially coming from someone who has interacted with unbelievable talent and work ethic.

In regards to character, we should be judged by our own standard for excellence, not by the outcome, social media, or others' opinions. Coach K doesn't prepare any differently for a game against their rival University of North Carolina. Win or lose, he focuses on the process of excellence.

Speaking on leadership, he says that great leaders change how they connect but not what they connect with. In all his years of coaching his message is the same, but he has to adjust to connecting with 17 year old kids when he's in his 70s. He has a Twitter and Instagram under an alias and follows all his players and keeps up with the fashion of the younger generation.

I was also surprised to learn that he was 72. He looks 20 years younger than his age and says he is still mentally and physically energized. He says what keeps him young is doing what he loves. It's a common theme among the many [impactful individuals](https://kevinarifin.com/impactful-individuals){:target='_blank'} I have followed.

## [**Guns, Germs, and Steel**](https://kevinarifin.com/guns-germs-and-steel){:target='_blank'}

![](https://kevinarifin.com/images/knight.jpg){:class='img-responsive img-container-center'}

I've been continuing my posts of the various books I've read recently, and my latest covers the key takeaways from *Guns, Germs, and Steel*. While many historians disagree on the validity of the author's thesis, his ideas provide an interesting lens to view the world.

These are the two big ideas I focused on:
1. Agriculture is the linchpin invention.

    The advantages of agriculture are obvious today, but not as obvious in the past. The civilizations that adopted agriculture had compounding advantages in technology, immunity to disease, and inventiveness that led them to dominate in a more connected world.

2. There is an optimal pace that ideas spread.

    This idea is related to Safi Bahcall's book *Loonshots*. The environment facilitated the spread of ideas in Eurasia but inhibited them in Africa and the Americas. But too much unification of ideas inhibited innovation, as unification promoted franchise projects instead of loonshots.

For a more in depth look at these big ideas, check out my post [here](https://kevinarifin.com/guns-germs-and-steel){:target='_blank'}.

## [**Ben Thompson's Thoughts on Libra**](https://stratechery.com/2019/facebook-libra-and-the-long-game/){:target='_blank'}

Libra is Facebook's push into cryptocurrency and blockchain, two overly used buzzwords. That doesn't mean the project doesn't lack importance. While the crypto religious may bash the project as not truly "decentralized" and not really a digital currency, the project still has a lot of potential. We'll try to stay away from these polarizing and confusing ideas and focus on how this product could affect you.

Basically, Libra is just money that's digital. It's stable (doesn't fluctuate like crazy as Bitcoin does) since it's backed by a mix of country currencies and bonds. So it's more convenient than cash since we don't have to carry around a bunch of coins and bills. But how is it different from a credit card? For a credit card, we have to trust a banks and corporations to facilitate the transfer of money and charge us transaction fees to do so.

Libra has all the advantages of credit cards in terms of digital payments, but decreases the amount we have to trust banks and corporations to handle our transactions. While people are scared Facebook will snoop on our transactions, Libra is only controlled partially by Facebook. Twenty-eight other corporations and venture capitalists including the likes of a16z, Uber, Spotify, and Stripe have partial control as well.

The purpose is to reduce the friction for online transactions. Just buy Libra and you can spend money online, and vendors involved will provide places to use Libra. Will this idea catch on? It just might be the widespread corporate support necessary to make cryptocurrencies mainstream.

We are all fools of randomness. Our brains have not evolved to be able to view things in a probabilistic manner. We convince ourselves that outcomes are the indicators of success but outcomes are merely a single path taken out of multiple possible paths.

In [*Fooled by Randomness*](https://www.amazon.com/Fooled-Randomness-Hidden-Markets-Incerto/dp/0812975219){:target='_blank'}, Nassim Taleb writes about his observations about randomness in his experiences, primarily drawing examples from his career as a trader and risk analyst. The book helped me think critically about the outcomes in my life and recognize the appearance of randomness in my life. Definitely recommend checking it out, especially for those interested in applications of statistics and finance.
