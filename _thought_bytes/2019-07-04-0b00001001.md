Happy 4th of July. I'm traveling back to California for the holiday. Hopefully the weather there is more consistently nice. Chicago has finally been getting warm, but the weather suddenly goes nuts with thunder, lightning and rain. If anyone knows a way to fix the broken weather, please give me an update.

On a side note, NBA free agency has been insane. As a Bay Area native, it's sad to see Kevin Durant leave the Warriors, but I've warmed to the idea of adding D'Angelo Russell. He's a 23 year old with talent and gets the opportunity to learn from the best shooting backcourt in history and they can build around him post Curry-Thompson or trade him for other assets. Would love to hear your take on the Warriors offseason.

Hope you have a great holiday weekend with fireworks, friends, and family. Until next week ðŸ‡ºðŸ‡¸

Sarah and I recently went on a trip to Bali. I track my movements with an app call [Arc](https://www.bigpaua.com/arcapp){:target='_blank'} and thought it would be cool to consolidate the week's worth of travels into a single map.

I also added some [notes](https://kevinarifin.com/bali) on our favorite places we visited and ate at on the trip. If you're looking to travel to Bali, feel free to reach out and I can give some recommendations.

* Favorite Restaurant: Wahaha
* Awesome Hotel: Rimba
* Most Entertaining Attraction: Sacred Monkey Forest

## [**A Brief History of Time**](https://kevinarifin.com/spacetime){:target='_blank'}

I wrote a [piece](https://kevinarifin.com/spacetime){:target='_blank'} on some of the favorite things I learned from a Stephen Hawking's *A Brief History of Time*. If you want to see me attempt to explain complicated scientific topics as a computer science major, you should check it out. I talk about understanding spacetime, elementary particles, and why we live in three dimensions. I'm not as gifted at explaining complicated scientific topics as Stephen Hawking, but I hope I give these interesting ideas some justice.

Tristan Harris is one of my favorite figures in tech today. He was formerly a design ethicist at Google and is now director of Center for Humane Technology. Harris focuses on how technology has come to control us and not the other way around.

We all feel like we have the freedom of choice in our day-to-day lives, but this is merely an illusion. No one wakes up thinking they'll be on their phone for 5 plus hours or open Twitter 40 times a day. The applications we enjoy using are made to play on our most instinctual desires.

Harris hosts a new podcast called [*Your Undivided Attention*](https://humanetech.com/podcast/){:target='_blank'}. The podcast explores these roots of technology addiction and the illusion of choice. The first two episodes discuss the design of casinos, with low ceilings and winding carpet paths. These trends are then related to the design of technology, and how the slot machine style user interface hijacks our sense of choice. It's addicting to see why our phone buzzed, how many new notifications we got on Twitter, or how many likes our post on Instagram got. It keeps us coming back, maybe even against our rational choices. Check out the first three episodes below.

## [**Inequality in Transit**](https://www.thenation.com/article/transit-deserts-extreme-commuters-inequality/){:target='_blank'}

My commute is a 15 minute walk to work. Many of my friends at work either walk or take the train, generally spending less than half an hour one way on their commute. Friends and family in the Bay Area generally drive or take the Caltrain, rarely spending more than half an hour one way as well.

We are the beneficiaries of commute inequality. This [article from The Nation](https://www.thenation.com/article/transit-deserts-extreme-commuters-inequality/){:target='_blank'} discusses individuals on the other end of the spectrum. Carrie Blough takes a 6:40 a.m. train from a Maryland suburb to downtown Washington D.C. and then takes another 5 minute train before finally walking 10 minutes to her destination. Karen Allen takes a 25 minute bus to work, yet it is generally 20 to 30 minutes late, making her commute almost an hour.

These are just two examples of 4 million workers who spend 90 minutes or more on their commute. It's a problem that is only getting worse as housing development restrictions within cities cause rents and housing prices to skyrocket and push lower income individuals farther and farther away.

Long commutes are stressful, eat up valuable time that could be spent working or with family, and are extremely costly. For a deeper dive into this problem, I recommend checking out the [article](https://www.thenation.com/article/transit-deserts-extreme-commuters-inequality/){:target='_blank'}.

## What I'm Reading

I've always been fascinated by cities, and while not a big gamer when I was younger, one game I could play for hours was Sim City 4. I found the book *Triumph of the City* through Devon Zuegel's [cities reading list](https://devonzuegel.com/post/cities-reading-list){:target='_blank'}. She was somewhat recently on a David Perell's podcast, and if you're interested in a [conversation](https://devonzuegel.com/post/cities-reading-list) about cities and how it impacts lifestyle, it's a great listen.

Edward Glaeser in *Triumph of the City* goes through the history of city development. As cities mature, they become healthier, better for the environment, and more attractive for ideas to succeed. While it's easy to mistake a city for it's beautiful skyline or iconic bridges, the essence of a city is its people.

Glaeser highlights how successful cities in today's world like San Francisco and New York championed ideas and education that empowered individuals to think and collaborate. However struggling Rust Belt cities like Detroit did the opposite: they focused on industry and the assembly line, which rather than empowering individuals to think, made it easier to remain an unskilled laborer. I'm just about finished with the book, and I'll feature a takeaways post in my next newsletter.
