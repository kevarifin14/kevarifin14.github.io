<p>
	Welcome to my website! I'm a first year Electrical Engineering and Computer Science student at UC Berkeley. I'm originally from the South Bay Area and attended Bellarmine College Preparatory. 
</p>
<p>
	I'll be sharing some of my thoughts and random insights as well as blogging my exploits at Berkeley and elsewhere. I'm a fitness freak, working out or playing basketball every day and recently purchased a Misfit to track my progress. I also love playing the guitar, reading, and just spending time outdoors napping on Memorial Glade or walking around town.
