<h2>Semester Goals</h2>
		<h3> February 1, 2015</h3>

		<p>
			Super Bowl Sunday has come to an end and this one was definitely a different one being away from home. I definitely missed my own coach with the huge TV in my family room! Instead I spent some time on the fifth floor lounge watching the Super Bowl while struggling to solve a perplexing CS homework problem (which I still have yet to solve!!). Anyways, it was a perfectly relaxing weekend and a definite calm before the storm as we slowly approach midterm season.
		</p>
		<p>
			Speaking of this semester, I wanted to share a couple of goals for the next couple months. First is the usual maintenance of grades, aiming for all A's and A-'s of course, continuing my "no B" streak to seven years! I know grades are somewhat meaningless but keeping up my grades is a way for me to challenge myself and keep me motivated. 
		</p>
		<p>
			My second goal is to add someting to my extracurriculars. Today I went to a Cal Sol Data team meeting and it was super interesting and something I'm really excited to be a part of this semester! It might be a little over my head at first but being involved with the community gives me an opportunity to learn from a bunch of smart upperclassmen. 
		</p>
		<p>
			My third and final goal is to try my best to search for an internship this summer. I actually read this great <a href="https://medium.com/@qrazhan/cs-internship-recruiting-guide-aebb68912808">guide</a> written by a Berkeley student that's been really helpful! The main iguidedea of the article is that to find a job, you have to be proactive and put yourself out there, which is one of my weaknesses. Even if I don't get an internship by this summer, it's a great learning experience putting myself out there, seeing people assess my strengths and weaknesses, and understanding how the hiring process works. 
		</p>
		<p>
			Goals have always been a way to keep myself motivated, but they are not the end all be all of achievement. Goals merely lay out the path for a journey, and it is the journey that allows you to grow and learn about yourself. Next week, I will share stories about what I learned through the journey of my semester in college. 
		</p>	
		<p>
			As is customary, I will share a song that's been particularly memorable for me this past week. I just realized that this goes along with one of the most influential <a href="http://mitadmissions.org/blogs/entry/50_things">articles</a> I read before I left for college that has definitely impacted my college experience. Take a look at number 3! Thank you for reading and I hope you like a bit of Spanish music!

<h2>First Week, First Post</h2>
<h3> January 23, 2015</h3>

<p>
	I find it fitting I finish up my first post at the close of the first week of the Spring semester. I am oddly excited to embark on this new journey of blogging, having all my life been fairly averse to social media, not joining the mainstream likes of Twitter and Instagram. Several things bothered me about social media these days but I'll boil it down to one driving opinion. Social media has turned into a contest of likes. Many posts or comments seem so superficial in an attempt to garner the approval of peers. While there is nothing wrong with approval per se, I do believe we should all be our true selves not just in the virtual context but in day-to-day interactions as well.
</p>
<p>
	Now I'm already rambling on my first post but you'll notice I tend to do that when I talk about things I feel strongly about. Actually, that goes along well with the goals I have for this website and for the year. My hope is that as my website grows, you'll discover more about me, what I believe in, and what I feel passionate about. In contrast to other forms of social media, I feel like this blog could turn into a true representation of me. It's also my goal (you could call it a resolution) for this year as well. Take a chance and be real with other people, even people you've just barely met. Sharing my quirky and oftentimes weird personality hasn't always been my forte, and this year I want to branch out more, developing new friendships and strengthening the ones I already have. Like my best friends Alex and Nick for example!

	As a noob blogger, I'm not sure what the appropriate blog length is, but considering I'm writing this at 1:29 a.m., I should end it soon (you'll come to know that I have become quite fond of late nights in college). I will always end my posts with some music of the week, usually something not so mainstream that you would know about. Recently, I've really been into Hendersin's remix of Don't Know Why by Norah Jones. Check it out-it's a bit on the smoother and relaxing side with a bit of rap.

	I'll put up another post soon with more than just introductions and goals on the blog. This was a lot more fun than I thought it would be!
