	<h2>Day 2 Rest and Relax</h2>
	<h3>March 22, 2015, 2015</h3>
	<p>
		Our second day in Vancouver was definitely as uneventful as it could be. I woke up pretty early this time, around 10 am to finish up some CS homework that was due this evening. Nemo and Lewis didn't wake up until past noon so I made myself an omelette and later had another one when they ended up waking up. I spent a lot of the day studying for Physics since I have a tough midterm coming up in two weeks and I'm pretty nervous about it! Nemo slept a bunch more during the day and Lewis played games and did some math studying.

		Our study breaks consisted of food. I ate three omelettes today, one for breakfast, another for the second breakfast, and then another for dinner. Lewis and I took an impromptu ribs break where we feasted on a rack of ribs from Safeway and Nemo didn't even know about it since he was sleeping. For dinner, we had an argument (in jest) about where we should go, and the chinese food we were planning on getting was unavailable since it was being renovated so we settled for Pizza Hut. Lame I know considering we're all the way in Canada and we eat Pizza Hut. I made myself an omelette since I didn't want to have too much pizza but ended up eating three slices anyways.

		I stopped studying in the evening and we watched two movies. During dinner, we watched Borat which was hilarious as usual, but it wasn't as funny as the first time when I watched it with Nick and literally laughed every five minutes. We then capped the evening with the third Night at the Museum movie which was a surprisingly good film and had a very touching ending. It was an overall productive yet fun and relaxing second day in Vancouver and I can't wait to see some sights tomorrow! Also, check out this song by Radical Something that I was groovin' to today while doing homework!
