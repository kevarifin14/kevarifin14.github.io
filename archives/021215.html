<h2>Taking a Step Forward By Looking Back</h2>
<h3>February 12, 2015</h3>

		Late post! I missed my usual Sunday night post deadline. Things really started ramping up in terms of school work! I've been working on the first CS 61B project of the semester and it's been a ton of fun building an augmented version of checkers. The staff gave us very little structure and I actually really liked that in contrast to 61A projects. It gave me the freedom to code it the way I wanted to, but it was frustrating at times trying to piece it all together. I'll put it up in my projects section as soon as I get the chance! Website development has slowed to a crawl since schoolwork has ramped up.

		As promised last week, I was going to share some reflections from the past semester. Three weeks into the semester, I can see how much I have grown in my approach to living the Berkeley life since last semester. One of the most important things I learned at Berkeley last semester was that hard work is a requirement, not an option, especially if you want to succeed. Hard work has always been a defining characteristic of my life, which allowed me to earn a spot on the varsity basketball team in high school and attend Berkeley to study engineering. So many people here have done amazing things, with kids from China starting their own startups to people in my CS class making awesome Scheme art! It's all a result of hard work and it reminds me every day that in order to achieve my dreams, I have to work harder. Fortunately, I love what I'm doing so it's enjoyable and part of what makes this Berkeley experience special to me.

		Another area of growth I experienced this past semester is looking past judgments of people. There are so many unique people at Berkeley and they all have done something amazing to earn a place at the university. It's surprising when you talk to fellow students and learn about how they started a company in high school or were national champions in a sport. It goes back to Ben Jones' article "50 Things." Number fourteen talks about the importance of embracing the differences between you and your classmates because every person offers an opportunity to learn something new. Even though it's sometimes hard for me to look past my own judgments, opening myself up to people at Berkeley has taught me so much and amazed me with the experiences people have had.

		This will be a fairly short post. I'm off to an intramural game (the first one of the season!) and I'm definitely excited. We lost a couple key contributors from last semester but it offers me an opportunity to play more point and get better at a position I never mastered. Of course I won't leave without a song for the week! I've been especially into Sam Smith this week and he just won a Grammy for "Stay With Me" so I'll share one of his songs to celebrate his award! Check out his popular song "I'm Not the Only One"! This one's a little remixed with a rap part at the beginning but it's just awesome.
