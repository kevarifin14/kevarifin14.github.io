<h2>First Week, First Post</h2>
<h3> January 23, 2015</h3>

<p>
	I find it fitting I finish up my first post at the close of the first week of the Spring semester. I am oddly excited to embark on this new journey of blogging, having all my life been fairly averse to social media, not joining the mainstream likes of Twitter and Instagram. Several things bothered me about social media these days but I'll boil it down to one driving opinion. Social media has turned into a contest of likes. Many posts or comments seem so superficial in an attempt to garner the approval of peers. While there is nothing wrong with approval per se, I do believe we should all be our true selves not just in the virtual context but in day-to-day interactions as well.

	Now I'm already rambling on my first post but you'll notice I tend to do that when I talk about things I feel strongly about. Actually, that goes along well with the goals I have for this website and for the year. My hope is that as my website grows, you'll discover more about me, what I believe in, and what I feel passionate about. In contrast to other forms of social media, I feel like this blog could turn into a true representation of me. It's also my goal (you could call it a resolution) for this year as well. Take a chance and be real with other people, even people you've just barely met. Sharing my quirky and oftentimes weird personality hasn't always been my forte, and this year I want to branch out more, developing new friendships and strengthening the ones I already have. Like my best friends Alex and Nick for example!

	As a noob blogger, I'm not sure what the appropriate blog length is, but considering I'm writing this at 1:29 a.m., I should end it soon (you'll come to know that I have become quite fond of late nights in college). I will always end my posts with some music of the week, usually something not so mainstream that you would know about. Recently, I've really been into Hendersin's remix of Don't Know Why by Norah Jones. Check it out-it's a bit on the smoother and relaxing side with a bit of rap.

	I'll put up another post soon with more than just introductions and goals on the blog. This was a lot more fun than I thought it would be!
