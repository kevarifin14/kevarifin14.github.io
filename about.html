    <h3>My name is Kevin.</h3>
    <p>
      I juggle way too many things in my life. Fortunately, for brief snapshots
      of my life I'm able to handle them. The Bay Area is my home. Technology
      and fitness are my passions. Dance and music keep my sane. But friends and
      family are everything.
