	<h3>The Village</h3>
<p>
	A limp body lay quiet on the shore of a deserted island, but a faint spirit in the body begged for mercy. It was the body of Father Edward Peterson, the parish priest at St. Thomas More Parish Community in Stamford, Connecticut, a city tucked in a rich corner of the wealthiest country in the world. Father Edward could see the whole city from his room at the parish with furnishing comparable to a king's palace. Windows so clear the birds would fly into them overflowed the room with light. The beveled ceiling flowing into walls whiter than a dove's feathers caused the room to appear almost heavenly. A silky carpet that massaged his feet seemed like ocean waves beating against a shore-the hardwood which still smelled of the rainforest. Several couches sat like soft rocks with a green blanket lying on the couch like algae. A closed door separated the lounge from his bedroom. Inside, the room was cluttered with his belongings. Bookshelves lined a wall with a rainbow of colors. His bed stood in the middle of the room which felt like sleeping in the palm of God's hand. Against the opposite wall lay his desk which overlooked the parish. He lined his various accolades across the rich brown desert the color of an eagle’s feathers-valedictorian at St. John's University, his Certificate of Ordination, and a letter from Pope John Paul II. Well-respected in the church community for his charismatic nature, he earned this coveted position despite his youth. His elders trust was well-earned, as he transformed the dying parish of St. Thomas More into the most vibrant religious community in New England. Nevertheless, it was general consensus among parishioners that Father Edward was not the gregarious type-they would rarely find Father Edward outside of the apse-though during his homilies, not a noise was heard from the congregation. The sun’s rays illuminated his glowing robes as his voice breathed life into the saints on the stained glass windows. Where am I? He awoke as the waves tickled his feet. He tasted the distinct iron flavor of blood and his head throbbed like an oversized watermelon.
